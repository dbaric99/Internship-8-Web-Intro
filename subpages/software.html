          Some things I've made that you might have heard of
        </h2>
        <div>
          <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/"
            >Google Chrome</a
          >
          &#8722; I gave it five years, from before release to 2012; I touched
          many pieces but I'm most responsible for the Linux port. I also wrote
          <a href="./chromiumNotes.html"
            >a collection of notes about the internals</a
          >.
        </div>
        <div>
          <a href="https://ninja-build.org/">ninja</a> &#8722; a small build
          system with a focus on speed; popular with Chrome and LLVM developers.
        </div>
        <div>
          <a href="./softwareSubpages/c-repl.html">c-repl</a> &#8722; a C
          read-eval-print loop (really!).
        </div>
        <div>
          <a href="https://github.com/evmar/webtreemap">webtreemap</a> &#8722;
          treemaps implemented using HTML and JavaScript (see also
          <a href="./softwareSubpages/chromeBinarySize.html">bloat</a>, a
          visualization of binary size).
        </div>
        <div>
          <a href="https://github.com/evmar/lmnopuz">Imnopuz</a> &#8722;
          multiplayer realtime web-based crosswords.
        </div>
        <div>
          <a href="./softwareSubpages/arabic.html">arabic</a> &#8722; a
          transliteration bookmarklet for typing Arabic on the web; likely
          obsolete but still a source of visitors to this site.
        </div>
        <div>
          <a href="https://github.com/evmar/lmnopuz">GtkSpell</a> is a
          spell-check-as-you-type extension used by many GTK programs. I was
          happy to see is, via <a href="https://www.pidgin.im/">Gaim</a>, in
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_and_You_and_Everyone_We_Know"

        <h2 class="title">Some other things I've contributed to</h2>
        <div>
          I was an early contributor to
          <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>, and later
          employee. I have fond memories, like carrying a server in my lap on
          the bus to go to Lj's datacenter.
        </div>
        <div>
          I reverse-engineered some of the Napster protocol and wrote one of the
          first third-party clients. I was soon hired to help design a Napster
          clone called Scour Exchange. Few people even remember these sites now.
        </div>
        <div>
          On a drunken dare I made a Windows-native theme engine for GTK. It
          eventually morphed, after removing all my bad code, into the standard
          Windows GTK theme.
        </div>
        <div>
          I wrote some moderately popular
          <a href="./softwareSubpages/greasemonkey.html"
            >Greasemonkey userscripts</a
          >. One made it into
          <a href="http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/">a book</a>.
