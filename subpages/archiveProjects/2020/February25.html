      <p>
        I was born in Los Angeles. My parents were programmers. (Random
        coincidence: they together worked with the now-forgotten technical
        cofounder of Amazon.) With my birth they decided they'd had enough of LA
        and they uprooted to a small town outside of Seattle. "There was only
        one traffic light when we moved there," my mom likes to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a kid I hated being out in the woods, where all I could do was read
        books, ride my bike, and build treehouses. As soon as I could I spent as
        much time as I could in cities; most recently I lived in San Francisco
        for about fourteen years. But with the birth of my own son last year I
        finally got to relive my parents' experience — a programmer in
        California with a newborn — and also their reasoning. Books, bikes, and
        treehouses sound pretty good in retrospect. And so, much like the salmon
        I grew up eating who swim back upstream to spawn, I have too moved back
        to the northwest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "I'm leaving California and here's why" blog post is almost its own
        literary form, canonically opening with a description of past beauty
        followed by a lament about how it was lost. Compared to the standard
        form I am more mixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be sure, the standard list of complaints about cost and trash and
        general dysfunction apply. There's a joke I make whenever I travel:
        "It's so clean here! The transit system is so great! Everything is so
        cheap!" It's funny because coming from San Francisco it applies pretty
        much anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        But also there is so much to love about the bay area, including the
        weather, the nature, the food, the job opportunity, and in particular
        the concentration of weird and talented people who are also there for
        those things. Out for dinner the other night I realized I was the only
        person at my table who was actually born in the US — the other five
        people had ended up in SF, far away from home, in part because they were
        exceptional humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if to remind me of what I'm losing, just after I decided to leave I
        ended up in the park with my AI researcher friend and her friend from
        the EFF as they discussed policy. (I recall when 22-year-old me
        considered the job offer that brought me to California, that the idea I
        might someday know someone from the EFF was genuinely one of the
        considered perks.) And if you had told me when I was growing up in the
        sticks that one day I'd have a real drag queen as a friend I'd have
        never believed you.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I wouldn't say I was eager to leave. If I didn't already live in San
        Francisco and I was asked to choose where to live, SF would definitely
        be on the list — especially if the cost of housing were comparable to
        other places. But for me the housing problem really isn't even about the
        price of buying a house (I'm lucky to be ok with and able to afford just
        renting) but it's all the consequential effects, like how expensive and
        scarce everything else becomes, and how everyone outside of my industry
        is priced out of the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the talk about prop 13 and NIMBYs, I can't help but also feel
        like the bay area is just full: even if more people could live there,
        the freeways are full, the BART is full, and everywhere you go there are
        waiting lines. (At my work, employed by a company with more money than
        God, we were stuffed in so tight there were even lines for the toilets.)
        Other "real" cities do way more density way better — after living in
        Tokyo, it's become a pet peeve of mine when New Yorkers brag about their
        supposed density — but I have trouble imagining how San Francisco could
        increase BART capacity given its inability to accomplish even small
        things. Since I left, the repeated failures of attempts by the state to
        fix its housing policy have only confirmed that impression.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so we moved to the Portland, Oregon area, in a place chosen for its
        proximity to my wife's family. Our house has a laundry machine (it's
        been 13 years since I have had access to one that wasn't a trudge
        up/down a hill!) and also trees. My commute to work downtown is still by
        public transit and takes about as long as my SF commute did, but unlike
        SF it's reliably on time and covers twice the distance because
        Portland's public transit isn't dysfunctional. I am sad to leave behind
        my morning walks to Dolores park and brilliant friends but I am
        cautiously optimistic that I will be able to make a good life here too.
