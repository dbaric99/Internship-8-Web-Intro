      </div>

      <p>
        In higher-level languages when there is a problem you get a nice
        backtrace pointing at the problem. In C or C++ you typically just get
        <code>Segmentation fault</code>. How can we improve this?
      </p>
      <p>
        To start with, you can catch SEGV and try to do something useful. Call a
        function like the following as early as possible during startup:
      </p>
      <pre><code>void BacktraceOnSegv() {
            struct sigaction action = {};
            action.sa_handler = DumpBacktrace;
            if (sigaction(SIGSEGV, &amp;action, NULL) &lt; 0) {
              perror("sigaction(SEGV)");
            }
          }
          </code></pre>
      <p>
        Then the problem is only as hard as dumping a backtrace. It turns out
        there isn't a straightforward way of doing this. glibc has a
        <code>backtrace()</code> family of functions but they don't tell you
        much: for example, you can get symbols but only those in your binary and
        no line numbers. Google's C++ utilities include
        <a
          href="http://code.google.com/p/google-glog/source/browse/trunk/src/symbolize.cc"
          >code for mapping addresses to symbols</a
        >
        that includes a ELF reader(!).
      </p>
      <p>
        Really, doing the full job, like getting symbols from any loaded shared
        objects, requires a lot of trawling through files and DWARF and
        <code>/usr/lib/debug</code> and gdb does it best. So why not just use
        gdb? Define <code>DumpBacktrace</code> as follows:
      </p>
      <pre><code>void DumpBacktrace(int) {
            pid_t dying_pid = getpid();
            pid_t child_pid = fork();
            if (child_pid &lt; 0) {
              perror("fork() while collecting backtrace:");
            } else if (child_pid == 0) {
              char buf[1024];
              sprintf(buf, "gdb -p %d -batch -ex bt 2&gt;/dev/null | "
                      "sed '0,/&lt;signal handler/d'", dying_pid);
              const char* argv[] = {"sh", "-c", buf, NULL};
              execve("/bin/sh", (char**)argv, NULL);
              _exit(1);
            } else {
              waitpid(child_pid, NULL, 0);
            }
            _exit(1);
          }
          </code></pre>
      <p>
        And with that, here's an example of a program that passes a NULL to
        <code>getchar()</code>; note how the dumped backtrace includes line
        numbers as well as code inside glibc:
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ ./parse_run
          #3  _IO_getc (fp=0x0) at getc.c:40
          #4  0x0000000000401bbb in Tokenizer::Read (this=0x7fff90656dd8, token=0x7fff90656d90) at build/scan.cc:40
          #5  0x0000000000402913 in Parser::Parse (this=0x7fff90656dd0, tokenizer=0x7fff90656dd8) at src/parse.cc:51
          #6  0x0000000000404db5 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fff90656ed8) at src/parse_run.cc:39
          </code></pre>
      <p>
        Is doing all this work in a SEGV handler legal? From a glance online it
        does appear to be ok to fork from there, and most of the work is done in
        the separate <code>exec</code>'d process. But clearly if you're in a
        SEGV handler it's possible you don't have any stack, which means the
        above may not work at all in practice. It at least seems to work for
        these toy programs.
