      <p>
        In late September I took a three-month sabbatical from Google. (This
        post was written both during and after the sabbatical; sorry for the
        mixed tense in some of the wording.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I told my managers: in the old days my officemates would make fun of me
        for being excessively optimistic and happy but more recently I had grown
        a reputation at work for being grumpy. I wanted to figure out whether it
        was my work or something else in my life that had caused this change.
        And thinking back, even through college I always took classes through
        the summer; I think my last real break from work of some sort was maybe
        my first year of high school, before I started working in the summers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've read about experiments where people stay in a place without the sun
        or a clock to guide their sleeping behavior, and how they fall into a
        25-hour schedule of sleeping and waking. I was curious how my life would
        similarly arrange itself without constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I made nearly no plans for my new free time. My wife works and I
        didn't want to leave her behind on some trip around the world. Instead,
        I had the vague idea to relax, work on projects, and catch up on video
        games. (I went cold turkey on games early on in college in an attempt to
        focus; in retrospect, putting Linux on my primary computer to help
        enforce that was likely a valuable career decision.)
      </p>
      <p>Here's what I found.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Work vs play.</strong> Even when I was working, I spent a lot of
        my free time hacking on software. It's something I enjoy; it's something
        I'd do even if it weren't something I could be employed for, so it's
        great people are willing to pay me to do it too. Without a job
        structuring my hacking time, I found that I fell into a pattern of
        hacking from morning to mid-day, then I goofed off for the brain
        downtime that frequently accompanies lunchtime through 3pm or so, and
        often returned to hacking in the evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was working I think I got my most productive time in after lunch.
        I think the reason mornings worked for me now is that there is nothing
        extraneous between me and my goals. At work there was always side tasks
        like email and keeping up with daily churn to occupy my mornings. With
        my new perspective, I wonder how much of that was self-inflicted; I'm
        considering strategies like "don't open mail until after noon" when I
        return to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Video games.</strong> The parallels to addiction are obvious to
        me, especially the modern horrible stuff like Zynga products. I think
        the way they hook is interesting to reflect on for a moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The joy of a good video game is the feeling of achievement you get. That
        is, I think, why they often hook the same personality type as a
        programmer's: making a WoW character and writing code have the same
        reward feedback loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        But since a game is synthetic, the achievement is also ultimately
        synthetic ("I pushed the buttons at the right times so that the reward
        light turned on"). The cynical craft of modern video games is tricking
        the gamer into <em>feeling</em> accomplishment without actually making
        them work for it. I read a review of one recent game (perhaps God of
        War?) where the reviewer discovered you could beat the entire game just
        by pressing the single attack button repeatedly — your character doing
        amazing leaps and smashes throughout — and it's interesting to contrast
        that with the reviewers trying to find the words to describe the sense
        of "real" accomplishment found in a truly hard game like Dark Souls. (I
        haven't played either.)
      </p>
      <p>
        With all that in mind, I think there is room in my life for video games
        just as there is room for alcohol. I'm not sure which, though; Skyrim is
        really pretty but I was let down by how every problem was solved by
        entering a dungeon and killing everything. Starcraft II is pretty
        amazing, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Getting things done.</strong> A few days into my leave I got out
        a piece of paper and made a list of all the sorts of menial life tasks
        I've been intending to do but putting off, stuff like "figure out to do
        with that cardboard box full of CDs". I worked through some of that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most stuff I own that lives in a closest is trash, almost by definition:
        I haven't used it. Much of it is in fact difficult-to-dispose-of trash,
        like old hard drives where I was afraid of leaking data. Or those CDs:
        given that I've re-ripped them, what is the ethical thing to do with
        them?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Living your dreams.</strong> When I was planning my leave I had
        wild dreams about getting fit or learning Arabic or whatever. Once I no
        longer had my job to blame for it I was confronted by what I already
        subconsciously knew: my own motivation is at fault. I was using "no free
        time" as an excuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daisy asked me recently: "Should I take a sabbatical too? Will it give
        me a chance to finally do all those things I've wanted to?" And my
        response was, "No, if you really wanted to do those things you would've
        found time for them already."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Money is a means to an end, not a goal.</strong> I have been
        very lucky in life, to have been born white in this country to a middle
        class family, so that I can be in a position to afford to not work. But
        I'm not some tech startup lottery millionaire; I'm paid like an engineer
        and I live well within that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do I enjoy the nicer things in life? Yeah, sorta, but not enough to
        strive for them. (Or, to use the "Your Money or Your Life" computation,
        it rarely seems worth it to spend another hour in a cubicle to have a
        more tender piece of meat for dinner.) It always felt so
        <em>natural</em> to work all day because that's just what people do, but
        seeing my wife leave in the early morning and return as the sun is
        setting really drives home for me how unnatural it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What now?</strong> I'm back at Google, still a little unsure of
        myself. I get no shortage of job offers but it's not clear to me that
        anyone provides a opportunity with as much freedom and the opportunity
        to work on free software as Google does. If you are also a Googler and
        have the opportunity to take a sabbatical, I highly recommend it.
