        <h2><a href="">Adventures in heap profiling</a></h2>
        <div>March 06, 2012</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        There's an obvious metaphor for heap profiling that I've yet to find a
        good opportunity to use, so here goes. Imagine you're investigating a
        company that is spending too much money. You have all of the credit card
        bills, but they only implicate the person who signed for a given
        purchase. Ideally you'd track down who authorized too many purchases.
        But then if you trace the management hierarchy all the way to its root,
        the CEO is ultimately responsible for all spending, and that's not a
        useful fact either.
      </p>
      <p>
        In code, your credit card bills are the calls to
        <code>malloc()</code> and your CEO is the <code>main()</code> function
        that invokes all the calls. Heap profiling, then, can be broken into two
        pieces: one, collecting the chains of authority, and second, analyzing
        those chains to allocate (pun intended!) blame.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start with the first one. Collecting a heap profile is as simple
        as recording the call stack at each memory allocation point, which is to
        say it's not exactly simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        First you must hook allocation.
        <a
          href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Hooks-for-Malloc.html"
          >Glibc provides hooks for <code>malloc</code></a
        >, and if you're using a custom memory allocator like tcmalloc you're
        already doing this as well, but there's also various pieces of your
        program like C++ or glib which may use its own allocation pools (for
        glib, for example,
        <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.30/glib-running.html"
          >you can adjust <code>G_SLICE</code></a
        >
        to aid debugging).
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your code is getting called at the right places, you must find a
        way to get a stack trace at runtime. One approach is to look at the
        stack for return addresses. It appears gcc for x86-64 Linux provides API
        for such at thing, but check out
        <a
          href="http://code.google.com/p/google-glog/source/browse/trunk/src/stacktrace_x86-inl.h"
          >the gnarly code Google uses for x86</a
        >; <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind/">libunwind</a> is a more
        recent implementation that likely works better. Another approach is to
        record extra information while the code is running; tcmalloc can use
        gcc's <code>-finstrument-functions</code> flag to hook
        <em>every</em> function call with a bit of code that simply maintains
        the call stack as an array on the side (a "shadow stack").
      </p>
      <p>
        Now you've collected a bunch of allocation stack traces, and it's time
        to shuffle them together. Typically this information is presented as a
        "top N" list or a tree widget, but tcmalloc provides a cool tool called
        <code>pprof</code> that generates those as well as input to
        <code>graphviz</code> to generate pictorial graphs. You can see a
        snippet of such a graph for GFS, the Google File System, on
        <a href="http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/heap_profiler.html"
          >on the tcmalloc heap profiler page</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, to map the addresses seen in the recorded call stacks into
        human-readable function names, <code>pprof</code> relies upon helper
        tools from GNU binutils such as <code>addr2line</code>, which turns out
        to be agonizingly slow â€” for Chrome I clocked it as taking over 4.5
        minutes to load a profile! For fun I recently dug into how this all
        works, and so I have written two programs to share with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first I wrote is
        <a href="https://github.com/martine/maddr">maddr</a>, a halfway
        reimplementation of <code>addr2line</code>. To map an address to a line
        number in code you rely on debug information, which is in an awkward
        format described in the DWARF spec. The line number info is a bytecode
        format that generates a large table mapping every offset within the
        binary to a source file and line number; <code>maddr</code> decodes that
        table into memory and does binary searches over it to quickly answer
        queries. In principle this could be extended slightly to support the
        same formats <code>addr2line</code> uses, and then plugged directly into
        <code>pprof</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I was curious about how the other pieces of all of this work, like
        how <code>pprof</code> shuffles the stacks together, and so my second
        program is the boringly-named
        <a href="https://github.com/martine/hp">hp</a>, which loads the heap
        profiling output as emitted by tcmalloc and generates graphs.
        <code>hp</code> is written in Go which makes concurrency so easy that it
        trivially uses multiple threads to load a heap profile and the symbols
        from a binary in parallel. It then has a "server" mode which brings up a
        web server, letting you adjust parameters (well, one parameter, but you
        get the idea) dynamically by clicking around.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can play with
        <a href="http://martine.github.com/hp/demo.html"
          >a demo of hp's output</a
        >
        online. (Caveats: it's a static snapshot so "rerender" doesn't work in
        the demo; it uses WebKit flexbox so it only works in WebKit. Use the
        middle mouse button to pan.) You could easily extend this so that you
        could click on the graph nodes to focus in on a single call stack, but I
        think I've exhausted my curiosity at this point (and I
        <a href="">no longer work on Chrome</a>) so that's all you get!
