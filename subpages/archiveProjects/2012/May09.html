      <p>
        I
        <a href="../../chromiumNotes/2012/February22.html">quit Chrome</a> some
        months ago. With more perspective on it I can now say I should have left
        earlier, which is sad to me because even now I still watch the project
        (and even occasionally participate). The many parallels to a breakup are
        not lost on me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a while to move on because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do. My
        farewell post above describes how my career already covered a
        computer-scientist arc and a free-software-hacker arc; what else would I
        like to try?
      </p>
      <p>
        And I eventually realized what I've missed is the generic employment
        experience: being paid to write code, not as an urgent need to solve
        puzzles and prove myself or as some statement of idealism, but rather as
        just applying my skills to help build something that's useful and
        selling that thing for money. (Even working on a product that makes
        money is something I haven't done in nearly a decade.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So, my new team: small, friendly. Includes women (that other half of
        humanity that is conspicuously absent from the salt mines of silicon
        valley). Some of us have kids. We work hard but also go home. I can see
        the ocean from my desk.
      </p>
      <p>
        The product itself —
        <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/"
          >Google Consumer Surveys</a
        >
        — is at first glance boringly corporate (to this day I still get
        "AdSense" and "AdWords" confused) but that's part of the charm. It turns
        out that there's more to it, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        In brief the product is almost two products: one is that you can create
        a survey with us and get a response sampling the US population in matter
        of days at an order of magnitude less cost than before. The other side
        is that website owners can run these surveys to be answered by their
        users one question at a time and get paid per answer at a rate that
        works out to be an order of magnitude better payout than display ads.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I find most interesting about this project is the greater social
        context. Ads, even the better relevant text-based ones, are always
        slightly confrontational with their subjects: the site owner wants you
        to click on their ads but isn't allowed to encourage you to; users
        rightly feel like a commodity that is being sold to an advertiser.
      </p>
      <p>
        With our surveys the financial relationship is made explicit. Our
        surveys always run in a format where the user must make a choice: either
        answer the survey or do a task specified by the site owner, such as buy
        access to the content. It sets up the expectation:
        <em
          >this content costs something to make and you must share that cost</em
        >. The user can pay with their data (answer the question) or they pay
        with their wallet, and they're always free to close the page if they
        reject both options.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that light you'll note that surveys, the thing the product is named
        for, are not necessarily even the point. Which is sort of apt in that
        it's not the point for me, either. I'll hopefully have some interesting
        war stories about being a web developer again after years in the browser
        world for you in the future.
