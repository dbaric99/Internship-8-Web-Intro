        I've had a weak stomach since I was little, but recently it got worse
        and in new ways. A few doctor's visits later I have something to blame:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease">celiac disease</a
        >, where gluten in my diet causes an immune reaction and damage in my
        intestines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gluten is a fashionable topic, especially in San Francisco. You'll meet
        people here who avoid gluten "just in case" (<a
          href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/02/20/is-avoiding-gluten-a-risky-fad-or-a-healthy-diet/before-going-gluten-free-make-sure-its-necessary"
          >here's NYTimes on that</a
        >); my brother's reaction to my news was to call me a "glutard". But
        while there is a spectrum of reactions to gluten that are hard to
        quantify, I learned that in the case of celiac disease the diagnosis is
        pretty specific: first a blood test then a biopsy of the stomach and
        intestine.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also genetic factor in the disease. Looking back now over the
        various dooms that 23andme predicted for me, it spotted that I had the
        gene and put me at 2.54x the average risk for celiac — though that only
        implies a 0.30% rate. Here's an interesting note from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease">Wikipedia</a>
        about the genetics:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Given the characteristics of the disease and its apparent strong
          heritability, it would normally be expected that the genotypes would
          undergo negative selection [... compare to how quickly lactose
          intolerace disappeared... however,] there is evidence of positive
          selection in CD genotypes. It is suspected that some of them may have
          been beneficial by providing protection against bacterial infections.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Beyond that, the cause is still kind of a mystery.
        <a
          href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/24/opinion/sunday/what-really-causes-celiac-disease.html?pagewanted=all"
          >Here's my selection for the best article discussing the mystery of
          its prevalance with some history</a
        >. That one also describes the interesting study comparing neighboring
        people on the Finland/Russia border with similar genetics/cuisines and a
        significant difference in incidence, which suggests it has something to
        do with the balance of intestinal bacteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I have a diagnosis it's mostly just kind of inconvenient. My
        diet didn't center around wheat before so it hasn't changed
        dramatically. Eating at restaurants can be annoying, but the world is
        much more adapted to celiacs today than it was before (I was surprised
        to read
        <a
          href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/travel/gluten-free-dining-in-italy.html"
          >Italy described as "heaven" for celiacs</a
        >). What I miss most is beer. At my work they serve dessert at lunch and
        I used to eat two or three desserts a day along with cookies later, all
        of which are now off-limits. (Somehow despite dropping both beer and
        dessert from my diet, months later I weigh exactly the same — a little
        bit on the skinny side of normal. Diet is a real mystery.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I think of my friends with much worse afflictions like Crohn's and in a
        weird way I feel lucky: that the diagnosis was quick (the internet is
        filled with stories of people who were miserable and undiagnosed for
        years), that it is not something more serious, and that my relatively
        mild symptoms have an explanation and treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting sick has given me a new sympathy for others who are sick. I
        understood in principle how feeling bad all the time affects your mood,
        but theory is no substitute for experience. No matter how hard you try
        being in pain makes you grouchy and affects all your relationships. In
        particular I hadn't appreciated how much unpredictability affects your
        life. It's difficult to make plans with friends when you aren't sure how
        you're going to be feeling, and when you're feeling extra bad it's
        frustrating and scary to not know why or whether if you'll be fine in a
        few minutes or hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, months after my diagnosis, I feel much better but still not
        100%. I find I keep accidentally dosing myself, like the delicious
        Arabic food last week where I didn't notice the noodles in the rice, and
        I hope that is the cause and not some as-of-yet undiscovered problem.
        Sources also disagree about whether soy sauce or whiskey is ok (I've
        been avoiding both). I am eager to feel well enough to establish a
        reference point so I can experiment a bit; I've already mentally
        designed some double-blind experiments...
