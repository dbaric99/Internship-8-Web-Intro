      <p>
        I've been tinkering on a project for a few weeks and I decided it was
        time to publish it somewhere else, just to have the work in two
        locations in case something bad happened. Of course in doing that I
        caused something very bad to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the early stages of a project I often have useless git history so I
        first wanted to reimport the entire project as a single new commit. I
        ran these commands:
      </p>
      <pre><code># Move the old git history aside.
        mv .git oldgit
        # Start up a new git history.
        git init; git add .
        # See what I'm about to check in.
        git status
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        But with that I had unintentionally added all the files in the
        <code>oldgit</code> tree, which isn't what I wanted. So without
        thinking:
      </p>
      <pre><code>git reset --hard
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        This restored my tree to its initial state â€” that of one without any
        files, deleting everything including the <code>oldgit</code> directory!
        Typically you don't need to worry much about resetting in git because of
        the reflog, but there is no reflog here because I haven't made any
        commits yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first I thought I'd lost everything: there were no files, there was
        no master branch, <code>.git/index</code> was empty. I'd even gone as
        far as composing an email to the friends I'd demoed the project to
        lamenting my mistake. But then I remembered that whenever something is
        added to the git index there's an associated object created under
        <code>.git/objects</code>, even if you never check it in. (These
        leftovers are part of why <code>git gc</code> is necessary to find
        things to delete.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So here's how I recovered. The very first thing to do is to checkpoint
        where you started at, in case something else goes wrong!
      </p>
      <pre><code>cd ..
        cp -a myproject what-were-you-thinking
        cd myproject
        </code></pre>
      <p>Then I extracted the contents of all the objects.</p>
      <pre><code>ls .git/objects/??/* | sed -e 's|.git/objects/\(..\)/|\1|' |
        while read obj; do
            git cat-file -p $obj &gt; obj/$obj
        done
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        (After writing this post,
        <a href="http://plasmasturm.org/">Aristotle</a> told me a better way to
        do this:
      </p>
      <pre><code>git fsck --unreachable --no-reflogs --no-progress |
        while read status objtype objname ; do
            git cat-file $objtype $objname &gt; obj/$objname
        done
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        Note that my manual approach will miss packed objects, which wasn't an
        issue in this particular case but could be in other scenarios.)
      </p>
      <p>
        At first I thought I'd just be able to look through these to find the
        git "commit" object for my old master branch in there, but recall that
        all I had run on this git repository was a single
        <code>git add</code> which just added all the files as blobs to the
        index. All of the objects were blobs, no git trees or commits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The majority of these objects were from a <code>git add</code> of the
        files within the <code>oldgit</code> directory, so they were blobs of
        files containing git objects, or twice encoded. I figured I'd need to
        identify all the ones containing source code and manually replace them.
      </p>
      <p>
        But thankfully, running <code>file obj/*</code> found one file that it
        identified as <code>Git index, version 2, 20 entries</code>. That was
        the <code>.git/index</code> from the old repository, before I ruined
        everything. So it's easy to just paste that over over the new (empty)
        one.
      </p>
      <pre><code>cp obj/4a92e84106caea0835d918affe4735009b43d147 .git/index
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        With that, <code>git status</code> showed that it expected there to be
        20 files, each in their original locations. So finally, for each file
        mentioned in the index, I could just check it out again. (Recall that
        "checkout" in git means "make the file on disk match the file in the
        index".)
      </p>
      <pre><code>git ls-files | xargs git checkout
        </code></pre>
      <p>And my files were restored. And this time I will be more careful.</p>
