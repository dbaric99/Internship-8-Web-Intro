          <a href="">Arch Linux on a ASUS Zenbook UX305</a>
        </h2>
        <div>July 27, 2015</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        I bought an ASUS Zenbook UX305. For $700 you get a laptop comparable to
        a MacBook Air — even thinner, in fact. Pause for a moment and ponder
        over how cheap that is: it's about the price of an iPhone!
      </p>
      <p>
        The catch of course is that it comes with Windows and crapware — which
        is fixable by installing Linux — and that the build quality is surely a
        bit worse than Apple's (though so far it is surprisingly close!). Here
        are some notes on it, mostly around setting up Linux. The short story is
        that almost everything works great, most of it out of the box.
      </p>
      <h3>Hardware</h3>
      <p>
        First some brief notes on the hardware. Once you've decided to go with a
        Zenbook you'll find it extremely difficult to understand the differences
        betweeen all the various models. Even on the ASUS site there's mostly
        marketing copy with specs, and then they have some sort of page that
        lists tens of very-similar-looking laptops with an "add to compare"
        checkbox that appears to do nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as best I can figure out, the UX303 is the older model while the
        UX305 is this year's one. There are many variants, such as with touch
        screens (which I don't want); there's the newer UX305LA (with a Core i5
        processor) and the UX305FA (with a Core M processor). There may be hidpi
        ("QHD") variants, which I considered buying until I realized it'd just
        be more money to have less battery life. I ended up settling on the
        UX305FA, which appears the be the one commonly reviewed now. Its screen
        is about 160 DPI, which is roughly 1.7x "normal" DPI — high enough that
        I have to squint to see the pixels.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's one final variant of models — UX305FA-<em>A</em>SM1 vs
        UX305FA-<em>U</em>SM1. The latter appears to be the "Windows Signature"
        edition, which is where you pay more to not have as much crapware
        installed. I totally understand the business models and deals that would
        go into such a thing but it is still hilariously sad. Since I am
        removing Windows anyway I went with the cheaper one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bought mine from Amazon; the first one I got had a slightly-busted
        backspace key (you had to press it a bit harder to make it work) so I
        contacted Amazon. Within minutes they were mailing me a new laptop and
        sending someone to pick up the broken one, no questions asked. Amazon's
        customer service in these areas is so great they really have earned my
        business.
      </p>
      <h3>Windows</h3>
      <p>
        Clicking around in Windows 8 I mostly felt bad for Microsoft. They're
        clearly trying hard to make something nice (though I found it super
        confusing) but there's so much bad software on these things out of the
        box. Right after installing I got alarming messages about some awful
        antivirus wanting me to register. All the apps from the manufacturer are
        upscaled in a really gross way (I assume at 1.7x, matching the display
        DPI) where the fonts are all fuzzy. It's unclear how much of the bad
        stuff is due to business deals and how much is actually necessary to
        make the device work. For example scrolling in Internet Explorer seemed
        occasionally janky which could either be bad IE code or it could be a
        bad trackpad (i.e. non-Microsoft) driver, but ultimately it sucks either
        way.
      </p>
      <p>
        One last Windows 8 note. I was surprised to see it auto-opted me in to
        "Do Not Track" — I thought MS had backed off from that? The way it works
        is that during setup there was a step which was like "do you want to set
        everything else up automatically?" with a list of innocuous things it
        would do like set up hardware, and in the middle it had Do Not Track in
        there. I also played with their Netflix app a bit and then wondered why
        there was no YouTube app and then remembered there's also some history
        there too. Tech company drama is so amusing and sad. (Re-disclaimer:
        though I work for Google, it is as a random engineer so I have no real
        insights into what's going on behind either of these issues.)
      </p>
      <h3>Windows Recovery</h3>
      <p>
        The first step in the Linux setup story is to grab a Windows recovery
        image. At some point I might want to give this laptop away and it'd be
        nice to not inflict Linux on the recipient. Unfortunately, the ASUS
        recovery tool ("Backtracker") only wants to write the recovery image to
        a USB stick. After letting it do that, I wondered — how to back that up
        somewhere reasonable? I can copy the files but what about the magic that
        makes it bootable? The obvious thing is to just image the whole thing,
        but this USB drive is 32gb; it'd be nice to just back up the data from
        it. (Edit: I later ended up using the plain Windows recovery image tool,
        not the ASUS one. Hopefully that one won't include crapware.)
      </p>
      <p>
        After a lot of fretting about UEFI booting and GPT partition tables (all
        of this stuff is new since I last learned it all, and I don't really
        understand how it worked in the MBR days either) I finally realized that
        the USB image is a boring-old MBR one. (I have no idea how this works
        given the laptop appears to be UEFI booting; I have so little of an idea
        I don't even know if I'm using these terms right.) This means you can
        back it up by:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Grab the MBR: <code>dd if=/dev/sdX of=mbr size=512 count=1</code>
        </li>
        <li>Copy the files off of the vfat partition.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To recreate the USB stick, then, you do the reverse process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Write the MBR: <code>dd if=mbr of=/dev/sdX size=512 count=1</code>
        </li>
        <li>Recreate the file system: <code>mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1</code></li>
        <li>Copy the files back on to the vfat partition.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I verified this worked (at least up to the point of showing the ASUS
        restore UI) once, by wiping the USB disk and doing the above steps. I'm
        a little worried that the MBR includes the partition table which means a
        differently-sized USB stick won't be usable, but I hope if that comes up
        I could figure it out.
      </p>
      <h3>Booting from USB</h3>
      <p>
        In Windows, hold shift when you pick restart from the power off menu and
        it takes you to some recovery-related screen, which lets you enable
        getting into the BIOS settings, which lets you tweak the secure boot
        flag. From there I found that holding Esc while the ASUS logo was up
        would let me choose which device to boot from.
      </p>
      <h3>Linux install</h3>
      <p>
        I decided to go with Arch. If you told me two years ago you were putting
        Arch on a laptop I'd have said you were crazy but now I think it is just
        great. It's so nice to be able to just <code>pacman -S go</code> and
        know I'm getting a current version of the Go compiler with the links to
        source in the godoc browser working, not some old supposedly-stable
        version.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with my last two install experiences, just following the Arch
        instructions was fine. (Note: follow the "beginner" instructions, not
        the plain install instructions.)
      </p>
      <p>
        New to me was GPT partitions and UEFI booting. Apparently you no longer
        use <code>fdisk</code>, but instead <code>parted</code>. I just left the
        existing EFI partiton in place and deleted the others to make a single
        50gb partition for Linux. (So <code>/</code> is <code>/dev/sda2</code>,
        after the EFI partition.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Two other tweaks from their guide: I used a swapfile instead of a swap
        partition, and I'll use the remaining space for an encrypted home
        directory. Also, when running <code>genfstab</code> I left out the
        <code>-U</code> flag as I find all that UUID business annoying, but this
        detail is probably one you don't need to worry about.
      </p>
      <h3>Minor Arch notes</h3>
      <p>
        I wrote an earlier post about
        <a href="">Arch commands for Debian users</a> but I have two tips to
        emphasize:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The Arch wiki is amazing and extensive, so for pretty much any issue
            you can't go wrong by adding "arch" to your search query.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When you run a random command like <code>netstat</code> and find you
            don't have it installed, I learned you can run
            <code>pkgfile netstat</code> to print out the package name that
            provides it. You'll of course need to install
            <code>pkgfile</code> itself:
          </p>
          <pre><code>pacman -S pkgfile
        </code></pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>X setup</h3>
      <p>You need the Intel X drivers and the Synaptics touchpad support:</p>
      <pre><code>pacman -S xf86-video-intel xf86-input-synaptics
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        As far as I understand it there are two versions of the Intel graphics
        drivers. UXA is the old but working one (described as "mature" in the
        <code>man 4 intel</code> manpage) and SNA is new default. From looking
        at
        <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-video-intel/log/"
          >their git repo</a
        >
        it appears that SNA is still under active development.
      </p>
      <p>
        With SNA (the default setting), when I quit X my text consoles would be
        garbled. I tried switching to UXA and that fixes that problem but it is
        otherwise worse: it seems much slower and flickery, and alt-tabbing out
        of Chrome is laggy. I "fixed" this by just installing GDM (the graphical
        login manager), so that I don't use text consoles. I think this also
        enabled screen locking.
      </p>
      <h3>Desktop environment</h3>
      <p>
        In the first edition of this post I had a lot more details about
        configuring the trackpad, adjusting the audio settings (ALSA defaulted
        to the HDMI output rather than the speakers) and so on. But really I
        concluded there are just a lot of things you need to tweak to get a
        modern computer working (e.g. selecting wifi networks, adjusting the
        volume when you hit the volume keys) and I don't really want to fight it
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I gave up and installed GNOME 3, which I find pretty tasteful as far
        as desktop environments go.
      </p>
      <pre><code>pacman -S gnome gnome-tweak-tool
        </code></pre>
      <p>Then in <code>~/.xinitrc</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>exec gnome-session
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        You'll want to run <code>gnome-tweak-tool</code> to make caps lock into
        a control key and to change the desktop scale factor due to the high
        screen DPI. I found about 1.25x made things comfortable. Don't go too
        crazy with the tweaks, GNOME isn't really made to be that configurable.
      </p>
      <h3>Fonts</h3>
      <p>
        Install the
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Infinality"
          >Infinality bundle</a
        >
        as well as their recommended fonts (<code>ibfonts-meta-base</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from the single tweak to desktop scale mentioned above, I found
        all of the fonts (including the terminal font) look great without
        changing any settings at all, and I am pretty picky about this sort of
        thing. Maybe I'm getting soft in my old age.
      </p>
      <h3>Wifi</h3>
      <p>
        Since I've given up and gone with GNOME, I also installed NetworkManager
        which integrates well with it. Follow the instructions on the Arch wiki
        to enable it and you get a clicky menu for setting things up.
      </p>
      <h3>Chrome</h3>
      <p>
        As a former Chrome developer, I know that Google Chrome gets all the
        development attention and that packaging Chromium is a real beast. But
        the Arch Chromium packages are pretty nice and you can't get Chrome for
        Arch so Chromium it is: <code>pacman -S chromium</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the settings, search for [zoom] and adjust the page zoom to 150%, to
        make pages look the right size.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get Flash working you need to install it from AUR, which just
        extracts it out of the Google Chrome RPM.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Download the tarball from the
          <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/chromium-pepper-flash/"
            >chromium-pepper-flash AUR</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>Extract that somewhere.</li>
        <li><code>cd chromium-pepper-flash; makepkg</code></li>
        <li><code>sudo pacman -U chromium-pepper-flash*.xz</code></li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I know tweaking flags is a losing game but visit
        <code>chrome://flags/</code> and turn on smooth scrolling. You'll thank
        me.
      </p>
      <h3>Remaining issues</h3>
      <p>
        As best as I can tell almost everything works great. (Remember back when
        suspend/resume used to be such a problem on Linux? Now it just works and
        is lightning fast!)
      </p>
      <p>
        The wifi in my living room is weak; our phones occasionally disconnect
        from it but our other laptops have been fine. This laptop seems to also
        have a really weak signal and I think it's disconnected once or twice. I
        vaguely recall reading a complaint about that in a review of the laptop,
        too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I notice some occasional graphical glitches in Chrome tabs. Switching in
        and out fixes them. I assume this is an interaction between GNOME's
        compositor and Chrome's, but it occurs rarely enough that it doesn't
        bother me (it very well could just be a bug in the version of Chromium I
        happened to install).
      </p>
      <p>
        The one issue I've encountered is that the brightness keys don't work. I
        can change the screen brightness via the GNOME menu but the keys do
        nothing. Ubuntu has a nice
        <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hotkeys/Troubleshooting"
          >page about troubleshooting hotkeys</a
        >
        and in following those steps I conclude that there is no low-level input
        event being fired when I press those keys, which points at a
        kernel-level issue. I note that the f3/f4 keys are unlabelled but
        hitting fn-f3/f4 produces key events related to adjusting the keyboard
        brightness (despite there being no keyboard backlight on this laptop),
        which makes me suspect it's using some similar-but-slightly-different
        laptop model's data for the key events or something like that. I am
        pretty sure the right bug to follow is
        <a href="https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98931"
          >this kernel bug</a
        >. It has a comment on it within the last month so I am hopeful; I'm
        tempted to dig in.
