      <p>
        The combination of my <a href="">health problems</a> and hitting my 11
        years at Google (I've been there longer than 99% of the company now!)
        have led me to take another sabbatical. I'm off of work until
        mid-October.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="">Here are my notes from my previous sabbatical</a>. Much like
        my previous sabbatical, I don't have any specific objective in mind. My
        wife is still working so I'm not spending my three months on a tropical
        beach, but rather just relaxing around the apartment, cooking more, and
        hacking on personal projects. Expect more blog posts, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I do have tickets to Europe and back in August for the
        <a
          href="https://events.ccc.de/2015/02/10/chaos-communication-camp-2015-save-the-date/"
          >Chaos Communication Camp 2015</a
        >
        near Berlin. (I'm not sure what to expect, but I've been telling
        skeptical family members it's "nerd burning man".) We'll be travelling
        in from Vienna up to Berlin and then back to the US via Iceland; if
        you're somewhere along that route and reading this, I'd love to have
        dinner!
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people, when told I'm taking three months off of work, immediately
        assume I'm starting a new business (which is not allowed, nor something
        I am looking into) or searching for a new job. And truthfully, at times
        I despair over big company syndrome and think about how my broad
        skillset (I take pride in being equally comfortable with
        <a href="">low-level systems guts</a> as I am with
        <a href="">high-level web development</a> among other things) would be
        more suited for a different job.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've even spoken with a number of startups, but most are (reasonably,
        understandably) interested in extracting a maximal amount of work over a
        short time window with lottery tickets as incentives, while I am not
        especially motivated by money and am more interested in living a
        balanced life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which another way of saying that I feel like it'd be a pretty ideal life
        if I had three months off like this every year. I've heard from friends
        who do contracting that you can maybe arrange this sort of thing. Are
        there any other options?
