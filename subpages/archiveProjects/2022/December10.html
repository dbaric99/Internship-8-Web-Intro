        Web development can be overwhelming, with frameworks and tools
        continually churning. Here's some advice that has worked well for me on
        my own projects which emphasizes simplicity, stability, and
        predictability. The recommendations I make here are only for tools that
        are high quality and which are unlikely to change significantly in the
        future.
      </p>

      <p>
        Like most things I write on this blog, my intended audience is more or
        less "me if I didn't know this stuff already", so if you're say a C++
        developer who isn't super familiar with nodejs etc and just wants to
        write a bit of TypeScript then this is the post for you. People have a
        lot of strong opinions about this stuff — to my mind, too strong, when a
        lot of the details really just don't matter that much, especially given
        how whimsical web fashion is — but if you are such a person then this
        post is certainly not for you!
      </p>

      <p>
        To start with, we're not going to use any preconfigured template
        repository. Blog posts like this one seem to usually start with "copy my
        setup" but that feels like the opposite of what I want — I want the
        fewest moving parts possible and to be able understand what pieces I do
        use are for.
      </p>

      <p>Instead we start from scratch:</p>

      <p>
        <code>
          $ mkdir myproject<br />
          $ cd myproject
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, for frontend tooling, npm is inevitable. (Installing nodejs/npm is
        out of scope here since it's OS-dependent but it's trivial.) Make your
        project a root directory for npm dependencies, bypassing any questions:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code> $ npm init -y </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        This generates package.json. Most of its contents aren't necessary, feel
        free to edit.
      </p>

      <p>
        With npm in place we install TypeScript. I think of TypeScript as the
        bare minimum for keeping sane writing JS and it's a self-contained
        dependency. We install a copy of TypeScript per project because we want
        the TypeScript compiler version pinned to the project, which makes it
        resilient to bitrotting as new TypeScript versions come out.
      </p>

      <p>
        <code> $ npm install typescript </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        This downloads the compiler into the node_modules directory, updates
        <code>package.json</code>, and adds package-lock.json, which records the
        pinned version of the compiler.
      </p>

      <p>Next we mark the repository as a TypeScript root.</p>

      <p>
        <code> $ npx tsc --init </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note the command there is <code>npx</code>, which means "run a binary
        found within the local node_modules". <code>tsc</code> is the TypeScript
        compiler, and <code>--init</code> has it generate a
        <code>tsconfig.json</code>, which configures the compiler. The bulk of
        this file is commented out; the defaults are mostly fine. However, if
        you intend to use any libraries from npm (see below) you will need to
        switch it from the default, backward compatible module resolution to the
        more expected npm-compatible behavior by uncommenting this line:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code> "moduleResolution": "node", </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point if you create any <code>.ts</code> files, VSCode etc. will
        type-check them as you edit. Running <code>npx tsc</code> will
        type-check and also convert <code>.ts</code> files to <code>.js</code>.
      </p>

      <p>Create some trivial inputs to try it out:</p>

      <p>
        <code>
          $ echo "document.write('hello, world');" > main.ts<br />
          $ echo "&lt;script src='main.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;" > index.html
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, TypeScript is only responsible for single file
        translation, and by default generates imports in a format compatible
        with nodejs but not browsers. Any realistic web project will involve
        multiple source files or dependencies and will require one last tool, a
        "bundler".
      </p>

      <p>
        Typically this is where tools like webpack get involved and your
        complexity budget is immediately blown. Instead, I recommend esbuild,
        which is (consistent with the spirit of this post) minimal,
        self-contained, and fast.
      </p>

      <p>
        So add esbuild as a dependency, downloading a copy into
        <code>node_modules</code>:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code> $ npm install esbuild </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        We invoke esbuild in two ways: to generate an output bundle and while
        developing. (You really only need the former if you're just willing to
        run it after each edit, but it's pretty easy to do both and it saves
        needing some other tools.)
      </p>

      <p>
        esbuild has no configuration file; it's managed solely through
        command-line flags. The command to generate a single-file bundle from an
        input file will look something like this:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>
          $ npx esbuild --bundle --target=es2020 --sourcemap --outfile=main.js
          main.ts
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        This generates a file <code>main.js</code> by crawling imports found in
        the given input file. The <code>--sourcemap</code> flag lets you debug
        <code>.ts</code> source in a browser. (You'll want to add
        <code>*.js</code> and <code>*.js.map</code> to your
        <code>.gitignore</code>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        You can just stick this command in a shell script or Makefile, or you
        can stick it in your package.json in the scripts block:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>
          "scripts": {<br />
          "bundle": "esbuild --bundle --target=es2020 --sourcemap
          --outfile=main.js main.ts"<br />
          }
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        and invoke it via <code>npm run bundle</code>. (Note you don't need the
        <code>npx</code> prefix in the <code>package.json</code> command, it
        knows to find the binary itself.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, the other way to use esbuild while developing is to have it run
        a web server that automatically bundles when you reload the page. This
        means you can save and hit reload to get updated output without needing
        to run any build commands. It also means you will load the app via HTTP
        rather than the files directly, which is necessary for some web APIs
        (like <code>fetch</code>) to work.
      </p>

      <p>
        The esbuild command here is exactly like the above with the addition of
        one flag:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>$ npx esbuild [above flags] --servedir=.</code>
      </p>

      <p>
        It will print a URL to load when you run it. This web server serves
        <code>index.html</code> (and other files like <code>*.css</code>)
        verbatim, but specifically when the browser loads
        <code>main.js</code> it will manage converting it from TypeScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the <code>esbuild</code> command does not run any TypeScript
        checks. If your editor isn't running TypeScript checking for you, you
        can still invoke <code>npx tsc</code> yourself (and on CI). If you do
        so, I suggest twiddling <code>tsconfig.json</code> to uncomment the
      </p>

      <p>
        <code> "noEmit": true, </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        line so that TypeScript doesn't emit any outputs — you want to use only
        one tool (esbuild) for this.
      </p>

      <p>And with that, you're ready to go!</p>

      <p>
        You might have some follow-up questions for recommendations which I will
        summarize in list form:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Autoformatting.</strong> prettier is standard but clunky and
          is set up similarly to how other tools here have been set up. dprint
          is a newer replacement that I have liked more but it's newer and
          riskier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Linting.</strong> The current state of the ecosystem is a
          general mess, I suggest avoiding it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> CSS languages.</strong> Too complex for my taste, possibly
          also because my projects tend to not be that visually complex.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Web frameworks.</strong> This is a much more complex topic,
          worth an appendix!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <p>Appendix: web frameworks.</p>

      <p>
        The above is all you need to get started, but commonly the next thing
        you might want is to use some sort of web framework. There are a lot of
        these and depending on how fancy you get the framework itself will
        dictate its own versions of the above tools. A lot of the churn in web
        development is around frameworks, so if you're looking to stay simple
        and predictable adopting any of them is probably not the path you want.
      </p>

      <p>
        But if you're again looking to stay simple and predictable, I have been
        happy with Preact, which is an API-compatible implementation of the
        industry-dominant React framework that is only 3kb. Unlike the above
        recommendations, I would note there's more potential for churn if you
        depend on Preact. But one nice property of Preact in particular is that
        it's intended to be a simpler React so it has a combination of limited
        API (due to small size) and well-understood standard API.
      </p>

      <p>To modify the above project to use Preact, you need to install it:</p>

      <p>
        <code> $ npm install preact </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        Rename <code>main.ts</code> into <code>main.tsx</code> and update the
        build commands to refer to the new path.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tell TypeScript/esbuild to interpret the <code>.tsx</code> file as
        preact by changing two settings within <code>tsconfig.json</code>:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>
          "jsx": "react-jsx",<br />
          "jsxImportSource": "preact",
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>
        For completeness, I'll change the source files to a preact hello-world.
        Add a body tag to <code>index.html</code>:
      </p>

      <p>
        <code>
          &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;<br />
          &lt;script src='main.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>And call into preact from <code>main.tsx</code>:</p>

      <p>
        <code>
          import * as preact from 'preact';<br /><br />

          preact.render(&lt;h1&gt;hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;, document.body);
        </code>
      </p>

      <p>That ends up enough for most things I do, hope it works for you!</p>
