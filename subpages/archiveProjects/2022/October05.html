        People occasionally contact me to ask what software I use to run this
        site. There are a lot of complex dynamic options (like Wordpress) and a
        lot of complex static options (like Jekyll), but my needs — and likely
        yours! — are pretty simple. This site relies on
        <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/"
          >aggressively boring technology</a
        >: it was a small Python script for many years, and when the Python 2 to
        the 3 upgrade screwed me over I rewrote it in Go in an evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The code.</strong>
        <a href="https://github.com/evmar/cms">The code is on GitHub</a> but
        it's not interesting, which is the whole point. The input is a few
        <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/html/template">Go templates</a> — I used
        jinja2 when it was Python — and a tree of markdown files. The output is
        HTML files (one to one with the markdown) and <a href="">a feed</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Static serving.</strong> I see a lot of people who make websites
        worry about serving performance. In practice, serving static files will
        scale plenty for anything you'll ever publish. I host this site on
        <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech</a>, which
        I have no affiliation with but I am happy with. It appears to be run by
        a grumpy Unix sysadmin which is just my vibe; I publish using rsync. You
        pay by usage (storage and bandwidth), and for my usage the site costs
        about 50 cents a month. This is actually overpaying because I am too
        lazy to delete the decade-old access logs. (Now that I'm looking, I
        notice on months where I had a popular post I was charged ~$1.50.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Static generation.</strong> I also see people complain about the
        performance of static site generation software, but in my experience
        generating static files is also trivial and fast. The above program does
        the obvious thing of walking the input path to gather all the markdown
        files to regenerate all the output files every time it's run, and for
        this blog it does so in like 40ms. Perhaps if I had more posts it would
        be slower? But even if I had 25x the posts it's still only a second.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Generating a blog.</strong> The blog-specific part of the
        generator software is maybe half the code weight, because for the blog
        there is some custom logic to generate a few different views like the
        post archive. This works by loading up all the blog posts then
        generating all the views from those posts. Each blog post input file
        starts with some metadata including a date stamp, which affects the
        output path. I feel like even this description is more words than
        necessary; the total logic is 200 lines of Go, which itself is not even
        an especially terse language.
      </p>

      <p>
        (By the way, blog software traditionally dumps a collection of recent
        posts in one single page.
        <a href="">See my old post on why this idea is obsolete</a>.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Editing tools.</strong> I used to draft the posts in a local
        text editor, but more recently I have moved to drafting in Google Docs.
        This lets me occasionally ask friends to review a post. I don't often do
        this, but in particular sometimes I try to paraphrase what someone else
        said and I worry about misquoting them. Once I'm done I copy it into
        VSCode, which has a builtin Markdown preview.
        <code>prettier -w --prose-wrap always</code> is a Markdown
        autoformatter, useful if you're compulsive about autoformatting like me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Low maintenance.</strong> The Python2 version of the code worked
        mostly unmodified for over 10 years; I expect the Go version,
        <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat"
          >with Go's emphasis on stability</a
        >, to also last a long time. The biggest risk is probably the single
        external dependency, on a Markdown parser. The biggest downside of my
        approach is that it's not especially convenient to publish a new post
        relative how it might hypothetically work with a webapp, but even that
        hurdle is only as complicated as creating a text file and running a
        script when I want to publish it. In contrast, the upside of zero
        maintenance (Wordpress has already had 5 more CVEs this year) is pretty
        huge.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>It's easy.</strong> In all, this stack is fast, does exactly
        what I want, and is low risk in terms of my time. I wanted to publish
        the above to encourage you to try it too.
