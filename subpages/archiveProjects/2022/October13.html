      <h2 class="sub-title"><a href="">retrowin32, a win32 emulator</a></h2>
      <span class="publish-date">October 13, 2022</span>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          My first <a href="../2022/September29.html">post-Figma</a>
          hobby project is a win32 emulator I've called
          <a href="https://github.com/evmar/retrowin32">retrowin32</a>. It is
          now barely capable of executing a few unmodified Windows exe files in
          a browser (see the site for some links).
        </p>

        <p>
          I think I started thinking about this idea when I read the remark
          "win32 is the stable Linux userland ABI". That is, Linux churns so
          much that a given program written today won't work in a year;
          meanwhile, programs written in the Windows 95 32-bit era are
          guaranteed to never change again. You can kinda look at win32 (that
          is, 32-bit Windows) today as similar to a NES — an old platform that
          you can emulate by "just" emulating all the chips.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are other projects to run old Windows programs.
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoW64">WoW64</a> is the name of
          the system within 64-bit Windows that makes old 32-bit Windows
          programs run. <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> shims the
          Windows API onto your host system — see the great
          <a href="https://werat.dev/blog/how-wine-works-101/"
            >How Wine works</a
          >
          for a deep dive on what that means. And system emulator projects like
          <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">qemu</a> emulate a full x86 machine
          such that you can install Windows onto them. But Wow64 requires
          running 64-bit Windows, Wine requires x86 hardware, and qemu requires
          installing the full Windows OS into the emulator to run a Windows
          program.
        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast, my toy emulates an x86 and enough of the Windows API to
          take a plain exe file and run it directly in my browser. It's
          definitely still at the "toy" phase of things but I've only been
          tinkering on it a month and it's been fun — exactly the kind of "not
          very useful but brain-tickling" kind of work I would love to be able
          to retire and spend my days on.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2>How it works</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          There's two major pieces to emulating a Windows program, the x86 part
          and the Windows part.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fundamentally a Windows program includes x86 instructions, so you need
          to emulate an x86. I made the dumbest slowest thing that iterates the
          instruction stream and runs the operations as it sees them. In
          contrast, qemu has a
          <a
            href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix05/tech/freenix/full_papers/bellard/bellard.pdf"
            >neat technique</a
          >
          for an architecture-independent(!) JIT for x86 code. (I really
          recommend the paper, it's an easy read and pretty rad approach —
          pretty much what you'd expect from a genius like Bellard...). I think
          the
          <a href="https://leaningtech.com/webvm/">CheerpX</a> people have done
          a similar thing targeting Wasm, though I can't find much about it. I'm
          interested in looking into this area in general but I haven't yet.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other piece to running a Windows program is all the things that
          make Windows distinct from other x86 operating systems. A Windows exe
          file encodes a bunch of information about how the file is to be loaded
          into memory and in particular which calls it makes into the massive
          Windows API. retrowin32 loads such a file into its simulated x86
          memory and provides implementations of the API (more on that in a
          sec).
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2>File formats</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          It's kind of amazing to look at the archaeology of how Windows works
          because it's the accumulation of cruft over literally decades. For
          example every exe file first begins with a DOS program that prints
          "This program cannot be run in DOS mode" followed by more headers that
          are then parsed by Windows. All over the various formats there are
          places where things feel like they were retrofitted in later — for
          example in the BMP format if the encoded image height is negative that
          means the encoded pixel rows are top-down (vs BMP's default
          bottom-up). Resources (static structured data like menus and icons)
          are modeled using a generic nested directory structure of blocks
          pointing to child blocks, only to only ever be used to have exactly
          three levels of nesting. And so on.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's easy to say from today's world of JSON and protobufs that it
          feels much more obvious that a file format benefits from having a
          unified structure that has evolution built in. A lot of parsing PE
          ends up with one-offy like "if the high bit is set that means this is
          an integer, otherwise it's an offset relative to some other field that
          points at a string" kinds of encoding. In contrast, for example Figma
          files are (mostly) in the
          <a href="https://github.com/evanw/kiwi">kiwi</a>
          format (basically the same idea as protobuf) so the parser for them is
          a simple codegen problem.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Hooking the Windows API</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          At a high level, DLLs work like this. The program's code at various
          points will say "call the function at memory address X" for some
          specific X. Then there's a table available at load time that says "on
          startup, put the address of user32.dll's LoadIconA function at address
          X". What retrowin32 does instead is poke a special
          otherwise-inaccessible address at those locations. Then if the CPU
          ever attempts to jump to one of these addresses, it instead calls out
          to my custom implementations of these functions. (You can click
          'imports' in the UI to see these.)
        </p>

        <p>
          It's a curious echo of how Wasm vs the host system works. My functions
          are passed parameters such as addresses, but those addresses refer to
          data within the emulator's memory. And similarly to return data they
          must poke that data back into the emulator's memory.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's a further layer of indirection because the ultimate target of
          many of these calls the TypeScript running the web page. So for
          example a call to
          <code>WriteFile()</code> that passes the stdout handle will first jump
          to my <code>WriteFile()</code>
          implementation, which then decodes the arguments and forwards them
          onward (via a Wasm bridge) to a TypeScript interface.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2>COM and DirectDraw</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          One of the finickiest pieces of this so far has been
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model">COM</a
          >, which is (in part) roughly the Windows mechanism for doing dynamic
          probing of API. In particular DirectDraw (the "fast" graphics API)
          uses it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let me take a deep breath and try to describe the
          <code>DirectDrawCreate</code> function:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>It takes a parameter, a pointer.</li>
          <li>
            Into that pointer the implementation writes a pointer to an
            <code>IDirectDraw</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            An <code>IDirectDraw</code> structure begins with a pointer to a
            vtable.
          </li>
          <li>The vtable then has pointers to more functions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          And those functions themselves may return further DirectDraw objects!
          DirectDraw surfaces themselves get plumbed up to eventually map onto
          HTML <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>
          elements. In all there are a lot of pointers, as well as multiple
          different memory spaces, to keep straight.
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Old goop</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          In getting the basic DirectDraw demo (see link on the project site)
          going I was surprised by how much API I had to implement. It turns out
          that between the kernel loading the executable and C reaching the
          <code>main()</code> function, there's a ton of stuff getting computed
          — all this parsing of the command line and the environment and so on.
          It's interesting how even in a low-level language like C complexity
          has accumulated.
        </p>

        <p>
          (If you load the demo, click "imports" in the lower left to see a dump
          of all the Windows functions this program uses. All that to show a
          spinny car.)
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Debugging</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          To get everything working (to the weak extent it does) I definitely
          spent some quality time with a debugger on the Windows side of things.
          In particular it's been fun learning
          <a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a> and mapping out my best
          guesses of what executables are attempting.
        </p>

        <p>
          Special shout out here to
          <a href="http://www.deanmcnamee.com/">Dean</a>, one of the gnarliest
          hackers I know, for helping me talk through some of this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, I also needed to debug what was going on within the
          emulator, so there's a web UI on top of the whole thing that lets me
          single step and examine the state. (I know the UI isn't great, sorry!)
          So on top of the emulator I guess I've built the beginnings of an
          x86/win32 debugger.
        </p>

        <p>
          I think having a web frontend to it ends up a pretty powerful
          approach, though maybe this is biased by my experience in web things.
          For one small example, if you click the memory tab in the UI and then
          click an address in the instruction stream it will jump the view to
          that address, and there are further effects on mouse hover.
          Implementing that kind of UI is trivial with tools like React.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the other hand, I'm also pretty deep in a stack of technology,
          between x86 and Rust and Wasm and TypeScript, so it's possible a more
          straightforward simple thing would've been easier to put together.
        </p>

        <p>
          (The way the code is structured it ought to be relatively easy to
          write a native frontend for the emulator, one that doesn't involve any
          web stuff at all. There's a "Host" abstraction that is implemented by
          a Wasm bridge but it could just as well have been SDL.)
        </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Where I'm headed</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          The thing that started me down this path was looking at
          <a href="https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=567"
            >one of my favorite demos</a
          >
          and being sad that I basically can't run this anymore. I tinkered a
          lot with trying to get it to run under qemu running an old Windows but
          it would just close on startup, maybe something about DirectDraw init
          failing? I ended up debugging it on a native Windows computer, but
          that computer is getting pretty old.
        </p>

        <p>
          It feels like there was kind of a sweet spot before GPUs took over
          everything where there's software like demos and games that likely
          don't require a lot of Windows API and are possibly old enough to be
          possible to emulate on one of these fast new Macs. It remains to be
          seen whether I am ever able to actually successfully execute
          <code>chillin.exe</code> — in particular I haven't thought much yet
          about sound and also it possibly uses threads, eek, and maybe it will
          still be too slow — but in all I feel like even if I fail, the general
          idea here is one whose time has come.
