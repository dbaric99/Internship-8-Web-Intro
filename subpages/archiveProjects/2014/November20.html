        It's sometimes useful if a program can say "this program was built at
        rXXXX". For example, about:version in chrome used to tell you the SVN
        revision your build of chrome is from, <code>clang --version</code> will
        list which SVN revision chromium's clang is built off of (Xcode's clang
        doesn't do this), and so on. If you know that a certain bug is fixed at
        rYYYY, you can use this feature to quickly discover if your binary has
        this fix already.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's an obvious feature, but it's actually a bit tricky to implement if
        you don't want it to slow down your build. Clang's Make-based build has
        a
        <a
          href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project/cfe/trunk/lib/Basic/Makefile?view=markup"
          >Makefile</a
        >
        that shells out to a script to get the current revision. The script
        calls <code>svnversion</code> or <code>git svn info</code> or
        <code>git log -1</code> depending on the checkout, then the Makefile
        does the same again to get the revision of the llvm directory, then both
        strings are concatenated and compared to the contents of a file
        containing these two numbers from the last build, and if the files are
        different it overwrites the file it just read. The "Version.o" file has
        a dependency on this file, so Version.o file gets rebuilt if it changes.
        This means that every time you run <code>make</code>, a bunch of scripts
        get run, hitting the disk a few times. Clang's Make-based build uses
        recursive Make so incremental builds aren't all that fast anyway, so
        this is good enough. LLVM also has a CMake-based build though, which can
        write ninja files, and ninja doesn't allow shelling out from its
        manifest files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before discussing that case, let's review how the same feature was done
        in Chromium. Chromium used to use a similar system as LLVM's Make-based
        build: The <code>lastchange</code> target (which also gets the current
        revision from the VCS and writes it to a file) used to depend on
        <code>build/util/lastchange.always</code>, a file that doesn't exist and
        never got created. So the <code>lastchange</code> target used to be
        built every time. Again, we used to use make which wasn't all that fast
        anyhow.
      </p>
      <p>
        (I think this used to be only the story on Linux and Windows. On Mac, we
        used to use a "postbuild" and store the revision in the app's bundle
        <code>Info.plist</code> every time after the app bundle got built. So
        this wasn't a problem on OS X. Since xcode had postbuilds, I taught the
        gyp ninja generator about postbuilds on OS X, but we feel that
        postbuilds aren't a great feature in general, so we didn't make them
        work on other systems.)
      </p>
      <p>
        When Chrome switched to ninja on Linux, running the
        <code>lastchange</code> script on every build was annoying. Originally,
        ninja would always rebuild all downstream dependencies, so lastchange
        would write the revision to a file on every build, and since chrome
        transitively depends on that revision file somehow, chrome would relink
        on every build, even if nothing happened. To prevent this from
        happening, Evan Martin <em>[ed: that's me!]</em> added this to the ninja
        generator:
      </p>
      <pre><code># Chrome-specific HACK.  Chrome runs this lastchange rule on
        # every build, but we don't want to rebuild when it runs.
        if 'lastchange' not in input: ...
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        This made builds fast, but also meant that your embedded revision would
        be out of date when using ninja. Peter Collingbourne taught ninja about
        "restat rules" (build edges that can cancel themselves if the output
        they produce is identical to the output they produced last time) and Ami
        Fischman changed gyp's ninja generator to make all custom rules restat
        rules — so when the contents of the revision file doesn't change, the
        build edge cancelled itself and Chrome no longer relinked on each build,
        even without the above hack. But the script to check the revision would
        still run on each build.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a seminal CL, Scott Graham realized that people always have to run
        <code>gclient sync</code>, and moved generation of the revision file
        from the build system into a
        <a href="https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/9169105">gclient hook</a
        >. (Back then, we had only few hooks — mostly one to run gyp — and
        people often didn't run hooks, so this was less obvious back then than
        it is now.) This was the first time that
        <code>ninja chrome</code> wouldn't run one step on every build, since
        the revision file would be written when you run
        <code>gclient sync</code> — the only time your repo's revision actually
        changed. (Richard Coles cleaned this up more
        <a href="https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10388213">a bit later</a
        >).
      </p>
      <p>
        This works fairly well for chromium, but LLVM doesn't have a script you
        have to run to sync — if you want the latest code, you just
        <code>svn up</code> or <code>git pull</code>, so Chromium's approach
        didn't quite work. They used to do the same thing every time CMake runs
        — equivalent to running gyp, but people usually don't run cmake
        manually: it reruns itself when your CMakeLists.txt change. Not every
        change touches CMakeLists, so your revision file was usually only mostly
        up-to-date.
      </p>
      <p>
        A previous attempt to fix this was to move the revision file generation
        into the build system and make it depend on a non-existent file, like
        chromium's 'lastchange' rule of yore, but that meant that
        <code>ninja</code> always ran that edge and the build never got clean
        (just like in Chromium), so that quickly got reverted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yesterday, Apple's Jordan Rose landed
        <a href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?rev=222393&amp;view=rev"
          >a change to LLVM</a
        >
        that solves this problem in a pretty clever way: He moved the generation
        of the revision file back into the build system, but instead of making
        it depend on a non-existent file so that it runs on every build, it
        depends on <code>.git/logs/HEAD</code> or <code>.svn/entries</code>,
        files that the VCSs update every time you sync. With this, the revision
        update script runs exactly if your revision has actually changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Relying on implementation details of your VCS comes with its own
        drawbacks, of course: If a VCS changes its internal files, this will
        break. And this already happened: SVN 1.7 uses
        <code>.svn/wc.db</code> instead of 1.6's <code>.svn/entries</code> , so
        Jordan already had to land
        <a
          href="http://llvm.org/viewvc/llvm-project?view=revision&amp;revision=222407﻿"
          >one patch</a
        >
        to make this approach actually work in practice. Still, this is probably
        the solution with the best tradeoffs.)
