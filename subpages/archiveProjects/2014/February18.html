        Some websites benefit from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application"
          >single page application</a
        >
        approach, which lets users navigate within the site without each
        navigation being a full page load. Gmail is one obvious example. But
        historically, the techniques used to implement single page applications
        have also made it easy for implementers to make a frustrating site: one
        where URLs don't make sense, where the back button doesn't work, or
        where links don't behave like real HTML links.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an approach to implementing the single page pattern on today's
        web that makes it easy to get it right. It's based on three principles.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Every view must have a real URL</strong>. On a normal web
            page, at any time I can grab what's in my browser's URL bar and
            either share it or bookmark it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Every link must be a real link</strong>. On a normal web
            page, I can view a link's destination by hovering it with my mouse;
            right-clicking produces a menu of link-specific options. So many
            otherwise-good pages try to implement their own link-like behavior
            by catching clicks on specific DOM nodes but then screw up corner
            case behaviors like middle-click.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>It's ok to be less awesome on old browsers.</strong> (Of
            course, whether this is actually true depends on your site's goals.)
            One tactic for old browsers is just to fail gracefully: if the site
            still works but is just slower, that's ok. For example, Gmail used
            to implement each of its buttons with a soup of DOM nodes to get the
            gradients and rounded corners to show on IE6; on today's web, maybe
            it's ok to just use some newer CSS for those effects and allow the
            buttons to be square and flat on IE6.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Now let's put these constraints together. Because of principle 1, your
        app must be capable of rendering any given view from scratch, because
        the URL load might be a freshly started browser that just loaded a
        bookmark. Because of principle 2, your links must be implemented as
        plain old <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags with an <code>href</code> that
        points at the URL of the resulting view.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, you could stop there and you'd have a working site: each link
        click would just load the target as a new URL. That satisfies principle
        3.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here, finally, you can sprinkle in the single-page magic. What you
        want to do is short-circuit some of those link clicks such that the page
        updates. You can do this in one central place by just intercepting
        clicks on <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tags right before the browser is about
        to use them to navigate, and then use the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history"
          ><code>history.pushState</code></a
        >
        API to make the URL update appropriately.

      <p>Some additional notes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            This implementation relies on the URL as the primary way of
            referring to a state. This means that there's only a single code
            path for rendering that is shared both by a fresh navigation and by
            within-app navigations, reducing the chances of those codepaths
            skewing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The <code>app.capableOfRendering</code> check can simply check your
            JavaScript URL routing code, and punt on anything that isn't
            rendered in client-side JavaScript. For example, if your site has a
            blog section that isn't really part of your app, by returning
            <code>false</code> here the browser will just do a plain navigation
            to that part of the site.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            This implementation intercepts all link clicks, which you might
            think means it'll ruin links for actions that don't have URLs. For
            example, you might have a little "change" link next to a text field
            to flip it into an in-place editor, as described towards the end of
            <a href="../2014/February11.html">my earlier post</a>. My answer is
            that because these "links" don't have URLs — there's no reason to
            open them in a new tab, for example — they are not actually links,
            and you shouldn't use an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag for them as you
            don't want the other behaviors (like showing the URL when you hover
            the link). You might be tempted to instead make this a
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with some <code>onclick</code> behavior,
            but if you do so you're again attempting to be more clever than a
            browser, and that will likely have other consequences (for example,
            keyboard focus will be wrong). If it's really a button in its
            behavior you could instead just style a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            This implementation is incomplete. Its button handling may be wrong
            for IE, it eats navigations to <code>#fragments</code>, it also
            should check the state of modifier keys, and it should handle clicks
            on nodes contained within an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag. These
            issues are small tweaks on the core idea; I left some out for
            brevity and mistakenly overlooked others. I think the right way to
            think about it is: whitelist in the one particular case you care
            about (left click with no modifier keys held on an
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag that's on-origin for a known path with no
            fragment) and let the browser handle the rest.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            This implementation totally doesn't work with search engines (unless
            they are capable of running your site's JavaScript). That is a
            subject for another post. The above is sufficient if your site isn't
            intended to be crawlable (again, like Gmail).
