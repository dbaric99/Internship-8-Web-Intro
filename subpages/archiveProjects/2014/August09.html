        Lately I've been using <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> as a
        way to gather things to read on my phone on my commute. (Sometimes I use
        it even to read an article directly, since their layout is more
        pleasant.) Their website and Android app are quite nice, and they even
        have a Chrome extension to make it easy to add things to your queue.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the extension requires the dreaded "Access your data on all
        websites" permission, and I found it even modifies some pages to add
        on-page "Add to pocket" links. This latter behavior is controllable via
        the preferences, but as a learning exercise I tried making my own
        extension that is as simple as a single button.
      </p>
      <p>
        I called extension "Save to Pocket (mini)", and you can get it from
        <a
          href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket-mini/calnfcidhlhdmmmnicdpddbmmjmfohem"
          >the Chrome extension store</a
        >
        or from <a href="https://github.com/martine/pocket-mini">GitHub</a>.
        Here are some implementation notes on developing such an extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, the mechanism to add pages to Pocket is implemented in
        JavaScript, which means you need to run some JavaScript when you click
        the extension's button. In Chrome extensions you can do this by making a
        "background page", which is effectively an isolated web page for your
        script, but this background page can run continuously and waste system
        resources. (There's some support for non-persistent background pages in
        Chrome but it's not clear to me when exactly they run.) Instead, by
        making the button display a popup I can run the script in the popup's
        page and be sure it doesn't live longer than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Chrome docs on how to get the URL of the current page without
        requiring the "all tabs" permission aren't very clear. It comes down to
        requiring the <code>activeTab</code> permission (which I believe is
        implicitly granted by the user when they click your button) and then
        (and here is the leap that isn't very clear in the docs) using a call
        like
      </p>
      <pre><code>chrome.tabs.query({currentWindow:true, active:true}, function(tabs) {
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        which normally would provide an array of all tabs, but in the special
        case of the <code>activeTab</code> permission returns only the current
        tab.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other interesting piece to adding to Pocket is getting authorization
        to work. The Pocket API uses an OAuth-like flow that took me a bit of
        poking at to get right. The way these flows work involve a series of
        steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your app fetches a token from the pocket site.</li>
        <li>
          Your app points the browser to a URL on the pocket site and includes
          the token and a target URL.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user clicks "OK" on the pocket site, authorizing your app access
          to their data, and redirecting their browser to the URL.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your app makes another API call with the token, receiving a permanent
          access token in the response.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Implement this is a simple sequence of XHRs except for step three â€”
        where do you tell Pocket to redirect the user to to complete the
        authorization? The answer is to use the
        <code>web_accessible_resources</code> stanza in your extension manifest
        to expose an HTML page within your extension, and then use
        <code>chrome.extension.getURL()</code> to grab a URL pointing to that
        page and use it in the above flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this page needs to do is resume the work of step 4. But that page is
        separate from the page that started the flow, so the token fetched in
        step 1 can't be carried in a temporary variable; instead, I stashed it
        in localStorage temporarily since the extension popup and the extension
        authorization page share an origin and consequently the storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all, this was pretty fiddly and not that satisfying to get working,
        and now that it is complete I find myself wondering whether there was a
        simpler approach. Had I poked around on the Pocket site some more I'd
        have found their page where they document the less-preferred API, which
        just involves
        <a
          href="http://getpocket.com/blog/2009/08/add-read-it-later-to-google-readers-send-to-dropdown/"
          >loading a URL with some specific parameters</a
        >. But the extension seems to work, so feel free to use it or at least
        refer to its code.
