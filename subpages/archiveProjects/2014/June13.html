      <p>
        When you have a collection of numbers — say, the time it takes to render
        a web page — it's instinctive to reach for the average as a way of
        summarizing the data. This single number then serves to represent the
        whole: "the site renders in an average of 50ms".
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an obvious observation: any summary of numbers like this is
        exactly the problem of statistics and statistics is filled with more
        principled ways of looking at data. But statistics is also intimidating
        and opaque so instead let's talk about it informally.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I told you that the average was 50ms, that statement conveys a mental
        image of the data: you'll intuit that it's usually around 50ms,
        sometimes faster, sometimes slower. You'd feel tricked (or just annoyed)
        if I then said that the underlying data was nine page loads at 10ms and
        one at 410ms. It's a trick because while the statement is true by the
        mathematical meaning of average, when we talk about averages we're
        actually conveying both the mathematical meaning and the
        <em>shape</em> of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's make that more formal. The mental image that "average" implies is
        a bell curve; that is to say, a normal distribution. A normal
        distribution is defined by two parameters, the mean and the deviation.
        Rather than overwhelming you with a list of sample values, I instead
        told you a picture of a normal distribution by telling you the
        parameter(s) of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why the average is frequently useful and sometimes totally
        misleading. Many data sets are normally distributed, or at least
        symmetrically distributed around the average, and for those the picture
        implied by the average works. But plenty of data instead matches other
        distributions (for example, anything "long-tailed") and for those the
        average is unhelpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some, when presented with this point, would cry for better statistical
        literacy. They'll plug data into formulas and brandish p-values and
        confidence intervals. That approach may be useful when everyone knows
        how to read those numbers but in my experience that usually isn't the
        case. (Frequently the formulas are applied wrong, or in circumstances
        where they're the wrong formula anyway.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead the point I'd like to make is that there is a useful middle
        ground between "go read a stats textbook" and "math is hard, let's use
        the average". It's useful to be able to talk about data without needing
        to produce every last data point; if you can swoop your hands in the air
        and say "it looks like <em>this</em>" then that is still communication
        and it's still better than a misapplied average.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example of that distinction. Life expectancy is a statistic on
        the average lifetime of a human, which is currently around 80 for
        developed countries. But lifetimes are not normally distributed:
        <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age-adjusted_life_expectancy#Life_expectancy_variation_over_time"
          >Wikipedia says</a
        >
        in 1600s England life expectancy was around 40 years, but that's
        primarily due to infant mortality; aristocrats who made it to age 21
        could expect to live into their 70s, which is pretty comparable to
        today's numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with any data visualization — even data visualization comprised of a
        single number — the first step before diving into numbers and pictures
        is to decide which question you're asking. If you're asking "where do
        people live the longest?" you will pick a different metric than one
        attempting to measure cultural progress in health care. And going back
        to the website example, if the question is "Is my site slow?" then maybe
        quantiles are more interesting, because they lead to statements like
        "95% of users load it in under X milliseconds".
