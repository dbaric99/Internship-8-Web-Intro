      <p>
        <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> is neat. It's a
        reimagining of how your DOM relates to your app state that dramatically
        simplifies code without being an enormous framework*. It also breaks a
        rule that I've never cared for, where your templates are supposed to be
        separate from your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        In React's world, each component (re-)renders its entire virtual DOM on
        any state change; React then manages updating the on-page DOM based on
        what changed. This means the rendering code only needs to model the
        static state of a component, rather than poking around in the DOM to
        transition between states.
      </p>
      <p>
        To facilitate this rendering, React includes an optional library/tool
        called JSX that lets you inline HTML into your render function. The
        translation is relatively simple. This code:
      </p>
      <pre><code>render: function() {
          return &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="foo"&gt;bar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;;
        }
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        becomes, post-translation, the not-keyboard-friendly but not hard to
        understand:
      </p>
      <pre><code>render: function() {
          return React.DOM.p(null, React.DOM.a({href:"foo"}, 'bar'));
        }
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        In words, the tag becomes a function call, the attributes become an
        object passed as the first argument, and the contents of the tag are
        further parameters to the function.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nice thing about interleaving code and DOM is that you can use all
        the normal JavaScript functionality in your template. Here's another
        example from the React docs with an embedded <code>Array.map</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>return (
          &lt;ol&gt;
            {this.results.map(function(result) {
              return &lt;li key={result.id}&gt;{result.text}&lt;/li&gt;;
            })}
          &lt;/ol&gt;
        );
        </code></pre>
      <h3>CoffeeScript instead of JSX</h3>
      <p>
        If you're using CoffeeScript, your source code isn't JavaScript to begin
        with. But turns out that CoffeeScript's flexible syntax makes it
        relatively painless to use the underlying API directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start with shortening the DOM alias and writing more or less the same
        code as above. Also note that you don't need to explicitly
        <code>return</code>
        as the last statement in a function is implictly returned, and that the
        function literal syntax for argumentless function is just a bare
        <code>-&gt;</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>R = React.DOM
        # ...
        
        render: -&gt;
          R.p(null, R.a({href:'foo'}, 'bar'))
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        But you can do better. First, CoffeeScript knows to insert the curlies
        on an object literal because of the embedded colon.
      </p>
      <pre><code>  R.p(null, R.a(href:'foo', 'bar'))
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        And then you can remove the parens by splitting across lines. When
        providing args to a function, a comma+newline+indent continues the
        argument list. Much like Python, the visual layout follows the semantic
        nesting.
      </p>
      <pre><code>  R.p null,
            R.a href:'foo', 'bar'
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        In fact, beyond the first argument, the trailing commas are optional
        when you have newlines. Here's the same thing again with two links
        inside the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>  R.p null,
            R.a href:'foo', 'bar'  # note omitted comma here
            R.a href:'foo2', rel:'nofollow', 'second link'
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        CoffeeScript also makes every statement into an expression, which is a
        familiar feeling coming from functional programming. It means you can
        use statement-like keywords like <code>if</code> and <code>for</code> on
        the right hand side of an equals sign, or even within a block of code
        like the above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a translation of the (7-line) <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> example
        from above.
      </p>
      <pre><code>R.ol null,
          for result in @results
            R.li key:result.id, result.text
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        There is one final feature of CoffeScript that I find myself using,
        which is an alternative syntax for object literals. For example, suppose
        in the above example the "key" attribute needs to be computed from some
        more complicated expression:
      </p>
      <pre><code>R.ol null,
          for result, index in @results
            resultKey = doSomeLookup(result, index)
            R.li key:resultKey, result.text
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        The simplification is that, within a curly-braced object literal,
        entries <em>without</em> a colon use the variable name as the key. The
        above could be equivalently written:
      </p>
      <pre><code>R.ol null,
          for result, index in @results
            key = doSomeLookup(result, index)
            R.li {key}, result.text
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        This is particularly useful when the attributes you want to set have
        meaningful names â€” <code>key</code> is pretty vague, but if you
        construct an <code>href</code> and a <code>className</code> variable
        it's pretty clear where they are going to be used. These can be mixed
        with normal key-value pairs, too, like:
      </p>
      <pre><code>href = ...
        className = ...
        R.li {href, className, rel:'nofollow'}, ...
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        Putting it all together, here's a larger example, part of an
        implementation of an "inline edit" widget. To the user, this widget is
        some text with a "change" button to its right, where clicking on
        "change" swaps the line of text out for an edit field positioned in the
        same place, allowing the user to make a change to the value directly.
        (Like how it works in a spreadsheet.) The first branch of the
        <code>if</code> is the widget's initial state; the
        <code>@edit</code> function flips on the
        <code>@state.editing</code> flag.
      </p>
      <pre><code>render: -&gt;
          if not @state.editing
            R.div null,
              @props.text
              ' '  # space between text and button
              R.span className:'link-button mini-button', onClick:@edit, 'change'
          else
            R.div style:{position:'relative'},
              R.input
                style:{position:'absolute', top:-16, left:-7}
                type:'text', ref:'text', defaultValue:@props.text
                onKeyUp:@onKey, onBlur:@finishEdit
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        To get a feel for these rules, you can just experiment and look at the
        generated JavaScript. Or you can go to
        <a href="http://coffeescript.org">coffeescript.org</a> and click the
        "Try CoffeeScript" tab, where you can enter nonsense expressions there
        just to experiment with the syntax.
      </p>

        * Though I do wish it was smaller. I wish I could cut all the support
        for old IE bits and the event handling abstractions.
