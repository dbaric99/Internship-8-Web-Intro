        Here are some life hacks you might have heard before: I don't wear a
        watch. The physical manifestation of being owned by time — literally a
        collar with the owner's name on it — makes me uncomfortable, and it's
        not hard to check a phone or a clock. I don't use software to notify me
        of emails, tweets, or blog posts. Any time such a notification might
        show I'm surely doing something else that I don't want to lose focus on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now take that reasoning further: It's not useful to reserve a portion of
        my screen for displaying which applications are running, as the things
        that are running are visible and the things that aren't visible can be
        found when necessary. There's no need for an icon displaying wifi
        status; if I'm connected it's uninteresting and if I'm not connected
        I'll surely discover it if I attempt to use the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took this reasoning to its conclusion. I run my computers with the
        screen blank except for the apps I run, and the apps I run I configure
        to display a minimal amount of information. I think of this as being
        <em>anti-dashboard</em>: against the cognitive clutter of extraneous
        information. My computer is not a cockpit and I am at my best when I'm
        only thinking about the single task at hand.

        It's important to immediately distinguish this argument from the rathole
        of endless productivity-optimization tweaking. I don't run a tiling
        window manager or any fast app launchers. I have tried that in the past
        and found the farther away from normal I got, the more time I lost to
        configuring tools and fixing software that hasn't anticipated my
        eccentricities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, I just turn off everything I don't use. I have one special
        keystroke, to summon a terminal, and from that I can run "time" or
        "google-chrome" or "acpi" as needed (that last one is for battery
        status). If I minimize a window it disappears completely, but I can find
        it again using alt-tab.
      </p>
      <p>
        This anti-clutter position is a goal, not an absolute. All information
        is always relevant to varying extents. Instead, I use it as a guide: for
        any pixel, does having this information always in my face make things
        better or worse?
      </p>

        If I've sold you on the idea, here's how I implement it. My
        <code>~/.xsession</code>:
      </p>
      <pre><code>gnome-settings-daemon &amp;
        xsetroot -solid slategray
        gnome-terminal &amp;
        exec metacity
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        Running <code>gnome-settings-daemon</code> lets me configure most stuff
        on the system by clicking around in <code>gnome-control-center</code>.
        For emacs, there are a bunch of settings I change, including
        <code>tool-bar-mode</code>, <code>scroll-bar-mode</code>,
        <code>mode-line-format</code>, <code>frame-title-format</code>; see my
        (messy)
        <a href="https://github.com/martine/config/tree/master/emacs.d"
          >config</a
        >
        if you care.
