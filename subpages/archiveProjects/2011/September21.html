      <p>(Apologies in advance for a very low-content post.)</p>
      <p>
        I read an article that pointed out that the core weblog format — a page
        containing a stream of articles in date order — doesn't really make
        sense anymore. That is, it surely still makes sense to collect essays,
        and you may as well collect them by date if you have no better axis, but
        the primary view where you spew the most recent N posts together on a
        single page doesn't stand up to consideration. Most of my posts are
        entirely unrelated to one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you examine it, I think that format dates back to an era where people
        maintained a single page by hand. Then, as people moved to databases, it
        was an easy query to replicate that behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I've changed the format here. The front page now contains the
        meta-information (who I am, what this is) that people typically attempt
        to stuff into a sidebar on every page; the post pages themselves are now
        just the posts along with a link back to the front. I think, if we were
        inventing the format now, this format would be a more natural choice.
