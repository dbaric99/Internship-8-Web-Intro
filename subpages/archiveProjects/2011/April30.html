      <p>
        I'm still a little embarrassed that I published my
        <a href="../../chromiumNotes/2011/February06.html">build system toy</a>
        but the response has been surprisingly positive. I had mostly intended
        for it to be used by me and perhaps one or two other Chrome developers
        who had similar sensistivity to latency.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in addition from my few brave coworkers who have been using it for
        their day-to-day development (of their own volition!) I've heard from
        people working on a CMake backend, using Ninja in a Scheme-based
        meta-build system for Erlang code (!), and even Windows developers. I've
        received a bunch of patches and helpful comments from users, too; around
        half of the commits over the last few months were from people other than
        me. I don't pretend that my project is major but it does seem to at
        least be useful for some others, which is about the most I ever hope
        for.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that despite there already being surely hundreds of other
        build systems, there was a tiny niche still available for yet another.
        My current theory is this: frequently the build system is the outermost
        layer in your project; if there is any feature you need while building
        (e.g. "how can I make it generate a zip file of all the source files for
        distribution purposes?"), then that feature must be implemented (or at
        least supported) by the build system. This leads to scope creep,
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7szfhaft(v=vs.80).aspx"
          >half-implemented programming languages</a
        >, complexity; those subsequently lead to rejecting existing build
        systems and starting over ("autotools is a mess!").
      </p>
      <p>
        By my design I get to cheat: I get to say, "If your problem is not
        expressed as straightforward commands that update files, go write a
        program that reexpresses your problem in that form." (It also has the
        nice consequence that this other program is effectively precomputing the
        state that other build systems need to compute at runtime.) So if a
        "<code>make dist</code>"-like rule that packages your source up is
        important to you, then you need to generate build rules that list all of
        your source files as the input to your zip command.
      </p>
      <p>
        By drawing the line at this point I simultaneously keep the project
        simple while counterintuitively allowing for more complexity than
        "competing" projects; for example Visual Studio's solution file system
        is great right up to the point where you want to do something that is
        not provided for by their system, and at that point you're out of luck.
      </p>

        I'm very worried about scope creep but I have a useful metric: does a
        no-files-changed build of Chrome take about a second? If no, then I've
        regressed. In fact, I did exactly this recently. The change was
        innocuous enough: I didn't canonicalize paths in all the places I should
        have, so these two commands would have different results:
      </p>
      <pre><code>ninja target
        ninja ./target
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        That's easy enough to fix (canonicalize the paths on input), but what
        appeared to be the same problem in a build file bit me. Consider:
      </p>
      <pre><code>builddir = .
        build $builddir/foo: [...]
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        where we should also recognize that <code>./foo</code> and
        <code>foo</code> are the same file. Again, it is easy enough to call the
        path canonicalizer on paths in the build files but it turned out that
        doing so regressed my performance metric by about 30%. (Remember, the
        whole point of Ninja is that it is fast because it doesn't do very
        much!)
      </p>
      <p>
        In writing all of this project I made a point of resisting my urges to
        be clever, instead writing everything as straightforwardly as possible,
        so that I could profile and optimize the code paths that really matter.
        (The huge mapping from paths to path metadata that I knew should've been
        a hash table and not the more convenient <code>std::set</code>? Yes, the
        profiler confirmed it should've been a hash table; that was a
        multi-second startup gain.) So confronted with this canonicalization
        problem I again turned to a profiler. It wasn't too hard to get the
        function performing better, and in fact improving on the performance
        before this fix by a few percent. I'm sure I still have some pretty
        simple tweaks I could make to go yet faster; I just haven't needed them
        yet.
