      <p>
        So you've been writing some C after using Python or Go or Haskell or
        pretty much anything other than C and you're jealous of being able to
        return more than one thing from a function. How do you do it in C?
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard way is to return one thing (perhaps the "primary" thing
        you're returning) as the return value, and then have the caller provide
        pointers for the rest as "output parameters". You <em>could</em> return
        everything by value in a <code>struct</code>, but it feels like all
        those copies might be bad, maybe?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's check. To reduce inlining confusion, let's split it across
        multiple object files. So here's the interface:
      </p>
      <pre><span class="keyword">typedef struct</span> {
          <span class="type">int</span> <span class="variable-name">a</span>;
          <span class="type">int</span> <span class="variable-name">b</span>;
        } <span class="type">Pair</span>;
        
        <span>Pair</span> <span>return_pair</span>();
        <span>void</span> <span>fill_pair</span>(<span class="type">Pair</span>* <span class="variable-name">p</span>);
        <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">fill_ints</span>(<span class="type">int</span>* <span class="variable-name">a</span>, <span class="type">int</span>* <span class="variable-name">b</span>);
        </pre>
      <p>And the trivial implementation:</p>
      <pre><span class="preprocessor">#include</span> <span class="string">"lib.h"</span>
        <span class="type">Pair</span> <span class="function-name">return_pair</span>() {
          <span class="type">Pair</span> <span class="variable-name">p</span> = { 3, 5 };
          <span class="keyword">return</span> p;
        }
        <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">fill_pair</span>(<span class="type">Pair</span>* <span class="variable-name">p</span>) {
          p-&gt;a = 3;
          p-&gt;b = 5;
        }
        <span class="type">void</span> <span class="function-name">fill_ints</span>(<span class="type">int</span>* <span class="variable-name">a</span>, <span class="type">int</span>* <span class="variable-name">b</span>) {
          *a = 3;
          *b = 5;
        }
        </pre>
      <p>
        And finally here's <code>main</code> to run it, including calls to the
        functions so we can see what work the caller must do.
      </p>
      <pre><span class="preprocessor">#include</span> <span class="string">"lib.h"</span>
        <span class="type">int</span> <span class="function-name">main</span>(<span class="type">int</span> <span class="variable-name">argc</span>, <span class="type">char</span>** <span class="variable-name">argv</span>) {
          <span class="type">Pair</span> <span class="variable-name">p1</span> = return_pair();
          <span class="type">Pair</span> <span class="variable-name">p2</span>;
          fill_pair(&amp;p2);
          <span class="type">int</span> <span class="variable-name">a</span>, <span class="variable-name">b</span>;
          fill_ints(&amp;a, &amp;b);
          <span class="keyword">return</span> p1.a + p2.a + a;
        }
        </pre>
      <p>And now to a disassembler.</p>
      <p>
        Starting with the last function, <code>fill_ints()</code>. Passing in
        two pointers means that two registers get addresses put into them:
      </p>
      <pre><code>   0x00000000004004e7 &lt;+23&gt;:	lea    0x8(%rsp),%rsi
           0x00000000004004ec &lt;+28&gt;:	lea    0xc(%rsp),%rdi
           0x00000000004004f1 &lt;+33&gt;:	callq  0x400530 &lt;fill_ints&gt;
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        and the implementation of <code>fill_ints()</code> fills in the
        pointees. Pretty much what you'd expect.
      </p>
      <pre><code>Dump of assembler code for function fill_ints:
           0x0000000000400530 &lt;+0&gt;:	movl   $0x3,(%rdi)
           0x0000000000400536 &lt;+6&gt;:	movl   $0x5,(%rsi)
           0x000000000040053c &lt;+12&gt;:	retq
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        The <code>fill_pair</code> implementation is similar, but with just one
        pointer and two offsets.
      </p>
      <p><code>return_pair</code> is quite different:</p>
      <pre><code>Dump of assembler code for function return_pair:
           0x0000000000400510 &lt;+0&gt;:	movabs $0x500000003,%rax
           0x000000000040051a &lt;+10&gt;:	retq
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        Because two ints fit in a 64-bit register, the whole function can be
        implemented with one immediate load and no memory accesses!
      </p>
      <p>
        But surely, you say, that's just because your <code>Pair</code> type is
        simple. How about pointers? If the second field were a pointer, it
        wouldn't fit into a single register.
      </p>
      <p>Here's what a pair of an int and a pointer compiles down to:</p>
      <pre><code>Dump of assembler code for function return_pair2:
           0x0000000000400510 &lt;+0&gt;:	mov    $0x40062c,%edx
           0x0000000000400515 &lt;+5&gt;:	mov    $0x3,%eax
           0x000000000040051a &lt;+10&gt;:	retq
        </code></pre>
      <p>Again no memory references, just registers.</p>
      <p>
        Ok, how about something that can't fit in multiple registers? Like say a
        buffer.
      </p>
      <pre><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keyword">struct</span> {
          <span class="type">int</span> <span class="variable-name">a</span>;
          <span class="type">int</span> <span class="variable-name">big</span>[1024];
        } <span class="variable-name">Pair</span>;
        
        <span class="type">Pair</span> <span class="function-name">return_pair3</span>();
        </pre>
      <p>and the associated code:</p>
      <pre><span class="type">Pair</span> <span class="function-name">return_pair3</span>() {
          <span class="type">Pair</span> <span class="variable-name">p</span>;
          p.a = 3;
          p.big[0] = 5;
          <span class="keyword">return</span> p;
        }
        </pre>
      <p>Here's the dump:</p>
      <pre><code>Dump of assembler code for function return_pair3:
           0x0000000000400510 &lt;+0&gt;:	sub    $0xfa0,%rsp
           0x0000000000400517 &lt;+7&gt;:	mov    %rdi,%rax
           0x000000000040051a &lt;+10&gt;:	movl   $0x3,(%rdi)
           0x0000000000400520 &lt;+16&gt;:	movl   $0x5,0x4(%rdi)
           0x0000000000400527 &lt;+23&gt;:	add    $0xfa0,%rsp
           0x000000000040052e &lt;+30&gt;:	retq
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        To "return" a large structure, the caller provides stack space for it
        and the function fills in the caller's copy â€” sorta like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_value_optimization"
          >the return value optimization</a
        >. This code is the same as the code that explicitly passes a pointer.
        (I don't get why this function adjusts <code>%rsp</code>, it seems like
        it doesn't even use it...)
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        In each of these cases, returning by value seems to equal to or better
        in terms of generated code to the approaches using pointers. So why not
        do it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some reasons. (Note that I'm avoiding C++ here, which has its
        own additional complicated rules as described in the above wikipedia
        article.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Most importantly, you need to create a new tuple type whenever you
            want to pass more than one value around. It is
            <em>inconvenient</em>, especially when the caller already has a
            variable handy for the value it wants to get back from the function
            and could just pass its address.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Passing structures via registers appears to be a newer ABI; gcc has
            <code>-fpcc-struct-return</code> and
            <code>-freg-struct-return</code> to select between them. But my
            system appears to be built with return-via-registers on (it appears
            that it as introduced into gcc around the year 2000) and even when I
            manually select returning via memory it just means
            <code>return_pair</code> and <code>return_pair2</code> decompose
            into the behavior of <code>return_pair3</code>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If your structure contains any character buffer the function gains a
            bunch of checking code due to
            <a
              href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection#GCC_Stack-Smashing_Protector_.28ProPolice.29"
              ><code>-fstack-protector</code></a
            >, removing the benefit.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            For larger structures, you may have to worry about stack space. But
            such things don't belong on the stack in the first place; you are
            working with pointers to them to start with so functions that fill
            in those pointers are more convenient anyway.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            (This point and the following were contributed by Jeffrey Yasskin
            after the post was first published.) If you return several different
            variables, depending on conditions inside the function, NRVO doesn't
            kick in. This is often a missed optimization in the compiler, but we
            still have to deal with it.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the return value owns some allocated space, you can often save
            allocation time by passing in a variable that already has the space
            allocated.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Insert your reason here. What else am I missing?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
