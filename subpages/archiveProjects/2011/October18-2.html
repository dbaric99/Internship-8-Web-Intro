        <h2><a href="">Arch for Debian users</a></h2>
        <div>October 18, 2011</div>
      </div>

      <p>
        I'm a long-time Debian user, since the mid-90s or so. I like their
        technical decisions some but what I really like is their
        <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">culture and goals</a>. I
        still wear with pride my old Debian shirt from the time I helped staff a
        booth at a conference. Later I reluctantly switched to Ubuntu after I
        repeatedly couldn't get my laptop wifi/sleep to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently got a new desktop system and hesitated when considering what
        to put on it. I don't much enjoy fighting with details and would prefer
        a system that just works, but I'm tired of fighting with
        <a href="http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html">CADT</a>-developed GUIs; both
        Gnome3 and Unity are too heavy and fiddly for what I want —
        <a
          href="https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2011/09/platform-of-the-future.html"
          >browsers and terminals</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I probably should've gone with Debian, but when I thought to my memories
        of it I also remembered it being heavy with policy: how the alternatives
        system always somehow picks the wrong program, how dpkg takes forever to
        update its database on each run, how the available software is always
        out of date. My work on Chromium has made me increasingly convinced that
        Linux distributions and policies are actually kind of the enemy of
        progress in the Linux world. I wanted something more minimal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years I've glanced at gentoo once or twice but I think the
        optimization fixation and building software from source is silly. And
        then there's Arch, which I'd ignored as a gratuitous gentoo clone. But
        recently I glanced at their home page again and saw their primary slogan
        is about keeping it simple, and thought: if there's anything I want
        after "working", it's simple, so I thought I'd give it a spin and report
        back for others like me.
      </p>
      <h3>System and culture overview</h3>
      <p>
        Out of the box your new system boots to a terminal and that's it.
        Installing even ssh or X is left to you. If I were to summarize the
        total Arch experience briefly, I'd say it's user-friendly if you know
        what you're doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most questions I've had have been answered by their extensive wiki,
        which has been consistently good. Everything I've needed I found with
        simple Google queries: e.g. [arch ssh] brings up the wiki page that
        decribes both how ssh is installed and what you might want to configure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Needing to know what you're doing contradicts my goal of Just Working,
        but there's a point where the other goal of Simple wins. I haven't yet
        figured out the balance, but lately I've been on a simplicity kick.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I knew that I had to install X and a window manager to get
        a GUI, and that that the keyword <code>ACPI</code> was the right place
        to start to look into power management (which also reminded me to set up
        CPU speed downscaling). For all of those instances, sticking the terms
        plus <code>arch</code> into a search found me a page that described it
        in straightforward terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        (That previous paragraph surely provokes a "buy a Mac" response in most
        people — almost including myself — but lately I've come to see ease of
        use as something that trades off with control: Mac window management
        drives me crazy, so I'm willing to pay a bit more in terms of fiddling
        if it means I can change the things I care about.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In sum I found getting my system working the way I want it to pretty
        easy, but I imagine if I didn't know how to describe the parts I wanted
        it would have been frustrating.
      </p>
      <h3>Packaging overview</h3>
      <p>
        Much like Debian, software is built centrally upstream and downloaded as
        packages, and there's a local dependency database that you can sync and
        query. There's no concept (as far as I can tell) of releases, or stable
        vs unstable, just "current"; it seems a recipe for disaster as soon as a
        large system update is needed but I'm withholding judgement.
      </p>
      <p>
        I especially enjoyed, keeping with the theme of simplicity, that
        packages are typically named just like upstream. There is no split
        between binaries/dev/doc. So e.g. instead of
        <code>libcairo2-dev</code> you want to install just
        <code>cairo</code> which includes binaries as well as headers and man
        pages. Similarly, the actual package files (not that you deal with them
        much) are tarballs of the build tree with one extra metadata file.
      </p>
      <p>
        (The one major exception is that they renamed
        <code>/usr/bin/python</code> to <code>/usr/bin/python2</code>, and most
        packages involving python are named like
        <code>python2-foobar</code> with <code>python-foobar</code> as the
        Python 3 version. It'd be nice if we could go back in time and change
        every program to agree with this renaming, but that's not gonna happen;
        I fixed this with a symlink.)
      </p>
      <h3>Repositories</h3>
      <p>
        So far everything I've looked for (including Chromium) is part of the
        main software repository. (I was pleased to see their package of
        Chromium includes the sandbox unmolested as well as the non-free codecs.
        I remain regretful that Chromium is a total beast to build.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But there is also a notion of experimental software, which is collected
        in a separate repository (called AUR) of user-submitted build scripts
        (called <code>PKGBUILD</code>s). You are required to compile such
        software yourself. I noted with some amusement that my
        <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=46233"
          >Ninja build system is available in it</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have downloaded a build script, the
        <code>makepkg</code> command (analagous to
        <code>dpkg-buildpackage</code>) runs it and produces a package that can
        be installed with <code>pacman</code>. It appears there is
        <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_Helpers"
          >no recommended way to fetch these from AUR</a
        >, though I've seen many online mentions of <code>yaourt</code>, which
        seems fine enough (though the gratuitous colors in its output are a bit
        annoying).
      </p>
      <h3>Apt/dpkg vs Pacman</h3>
      <p>
        Pacman lays out its subcommands in a different arrangement than the
        Debian suite. I found it only took me a day or two for the new flag
        names to become natural.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's only one tool: <code>pacman</code>, which subsumes
        <code>apt-get</code>, <code>dpkg</code>, <code>dpkg-deb</code>, etc.
        It's surely missing some feature of those tools but I haven't noticed
        yet. All commands follow a pattern: first there's a mode flag with a
        capital letter, then sometimes a submode with a lowercase letter. The
        important modes are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>-Q</code>: query the local database. <code>-Ql</code> lists
            files in an installed package (<code>dpkg -L</code>);
            <code>-Qo</code> reports which package owns a file on disk (<code
              >dpkg -S</code
            >); <code>-Qi</code> reports info about an installed package (<code
              >dpkg -i</code
            >).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <code>-S</code> (mnemonic: sync(?)): do something that (at least in
            concept) works with the remote database. <code>-Sy</code> refreshes
            the software index (like <code>apt-get update</code>);
            <code>-S</code> installs a package (<code>apt-get install</code>);
            and importantly <code>-Ss</code> greps the local copy of the remote
            database (like <code>apt-cache search</code>).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            To get source code for a package (<code>apt-get source</code>), you
            need to install the Arch ports tree equivalent ABS (<code
              >pacman -S abs</code
            >). Then <code>sudo abs</code> to <code>rsync</code> the tree down
            into <code>/var/abs</code>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Software setup</h2>
      <p>
        Daemons like ssh install a startup script in <code>/etc/rc.d</code> but
        it's also left to you to link them in to startup (<code
          >/etc/rc.conf</code
        >
        contains a bash array listing scripts to start/stop from the
        <code>rc.d</code> directory). This is described in the install
        instructions, but I note it in part because this strategy is a perfect
        example of the sort of simplicity I was hoping for: no
        <code>update-rc.d</code> script, no symlinks prefixed with numbers, just
        one file that says what to run. (On my system, that file, which covers
        locale, kernel modules, network setup, daemons, etc. is just 21 lines
        long if you don't count comments or blanks.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I had expected getting the NVIDIA binary-only X drivers to be a hassle,
        but much like everything else, searching for [arch nvidia] brought up a
        wiki page that made it simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        When running one tool I found it wanted to bring up an editor. It
        brought a happy tear to my eye to see it request I set
        <code>$EDITOR</code> in my environment. I didn't realize how much I
        disliked Debian's alternatives system until I was free of it.
      </p>
      <h3>Third-party software</h3>
      <p>
        A few weeks after feeling comfortable with the system I thought to try
        setting up my printer, which I didn't expect to work. (<a
          href="https://github.com/martine/envelope"
          >Read more about my printing fiasco</a
        >.) The vendor actually provides a source tarball of their Linux
        packages (I picked the printer in part for its Linux support) but that
        tarball contains binary shared objects, which were 32-bit binaries,
        which my system had no support for... and I expected all of this was
        going to be a huge hassle.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it turned out in the user software repository someone had already
        set up
        <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=46698"
          >a script to fetch Pixma 870 drivers</a
        >, and it worked just fine. I am still a little amazed it works. I think
        I just got lucky.
      </p>
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        Current versions of everything, simple tools, binary packages, good
        docs? Sounds too good to be true, and it likely is. It remains to be
        seen how hard it will break on updates, but otherwise so far I'm
        pleased.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect I wouldn't run Arch on a server (where I'm more interested in
        centralized management and getting timely security updates) nor on a
        laptop (where I'm more interested in having someone else work through
        the power management and wifi soup), but for a desktop workstation it
        seems like just what I wanted. We'll see.
