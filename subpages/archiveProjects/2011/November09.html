        The graphics world is a soup of terms and libraries, reminiscent of the

          >audio API jungle</a
        >. Here's my attempt at a glossary. As with many of my posts, I'm not
        confident in a lot of what I've discovered, so corrections are welcomed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>OpenGL itself.</strong> OpenGL frequently refers to suite of
        related pieces, but specifically it is the API used by applications to
        produce graphics: "load these pixels as a texture", "draw a triangle".
        The API has been around a while, with multiple revisions, and is pretty
        enormous and confusing â€” which API is available and whether a given call
        works is hardware-dependent.
      </p>
      <p>
        OpenGL has a system of extensions that are functions that can be queried
        for and called at runtime. On Linux you also must contend with the fact
        that the X server might support different extensions than the client
        library you were linked against; see <code>glxinfo</code> for gory
        details.
      </p>
      <p>
        OpenGL has had a variety of minor version increments as extensions are
        promoted to core functions, as well as some major version changes. Many
        tutorials you see only describe v1, which is the majority of the API,
        but the v1 to v2 change was large: OpenGL 2 introduced API to compile
        and upload code to the graphics card, which generalizes concepts like
        texture mapping. Despite there existing OpenGL 3 and 4, Mesa (see below)
        targets OpenGL 2.1, so that's the version of interest. (The OS X docs
        recommend targeting OpenGL 3.2.)
      </p>
      <p>
        OpenGL ES (Embedded Systems(?)) is a subset of the OpenGL API to a
        smaller core set of functions. (It comes in versions 1 and 2 to parallel
        the OpenGL version divide.) A device like a phone can promise support
        for "OpenGL ES" and then software authors can target it. These days it
        seems like increasingly all software targets GLES; though I would
        imagine demanding users like games use every function they can find,
        consoles and WebGL are both based on GLES.
      </p>
      <p>This API is small:</p>
      <pre><code>$ egrep -v '^$|^#' /usr/include/GLES2/gl2.h  | wc -l
        246
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        <strong>Associated libraries.</strong> Mesa is an (the) open source
        OpenGL implementation. Because there are so many layers to OpenGL, Mesa
        is the implementation of many of the below components, from user-level
        APIs through drivers, and various components have migrated into and out
        from the Mesa repository over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        libGLU, GL Utilities, provides functions like "map an error code to a
        string describing the error". libGLEW, GL Extension Wranger, provides a
        nicer API for probing and using GL extensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Platform bindings.</strong> OpenGL provides calls like "bind a
        texture" or "draw a quad", but you need to somehow hook the current
        OpenGL context to the screen. Historically this was done with
        platform-specific libraries: <code>WGL</code> for Windows,
        <code>CGL</code> on Apple, and <code>GLX</code> on X11. For example,
        <code>glx.h</code> has functions that take an Xlib
        <code>Display*</code> or a <code>Window</code> and let you hook up GL
        context to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are simplification libraries that abstract over these
        system-specific APIs, while typically also abstracting mouse/keyboard
        input.
        <a href="http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/">GLUT</a> is
        the standard one, but I've seen recommendations for the third-party
        <a href="http://www.glfw.org/">GLFW</a> and even SDL (common for games)
      </p>
      <p>
        The newer EGL ("E" parallels GLES) subsumes the platform-specific APIs:
        it has functions that work with an
        <code>EGLNativeDisplayType</code> which is typedef'd the appropriate
        things on various platforms. With EGL you can create a "window surface"
        and make GL calls on it. This includes support for platforms like
        phones; Mesa's EGL implementation has
        <a

          >Nokia provides a nice tutorial on using the API</a
        >. Because the free software world loves implementing APIs in terms of
        one another, Mesa's EGL implementation has pluggable drivers to layer it
        atop GLX or (see below) DRI or Gallium3D.
      </p>

        <strong>Kernel interface.</strong> The above describes the
        application-facing API. Diving deeper, DRI (Direct Rendering
        Infrastructure) is the umbrella project for hardware-assisted rendering
        on Linux. DRM is the kernel portion, managing access to the graphics
        hardware: it shows up in <code>/dev</code> and <code>/proc</code>.
        According to strace, a program that uses libGL and libGLX sends messages
        to the X server mentioning DRI as well as opening
        <code>/dev/dri/card0</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Drivers.</strong> It appears that historically it was up to the
        graphics card vendor to support OpenGL, providing almost the whole
        stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium3D">Gallium3D</a> is a
        recent effort to share more code between drivers: drivers implement the
        Gallium API and then Mesa's OpenGL implementation can target Gallium.
      </p>

        Nvidia provides a high-quality closed-source OpenGL driver for Linux,
        which provides its own libGLX all the way through to its own kernel
        module. (This makes the drivers tied not only to X but even specifically
        to Xlib;
        <a href="http://xcb.freedesktop.org/opengl/"
          >see this discussion of GLX+XCB</a
        >)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/">Nouveau</a> is a free
        software Nvidia driver with more bugs but more support for the new shiny
        (such as Gallium and EGL).

        I haven't read as much about Intel or ATI. It appears Intel mostly works
        in-kernel but has worse hardware, while ATI has a similar
        proprietary/free-software-rewrite driver split (but perhaps their
        proprietary driver
        <a
          href="http://mailman.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2009-February/010394.html"
          >isn't as good as Nvidia's?</a
        >).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Memory management.</strong> GL code sometimes wants to pass
        rendered buffers around between processes: consider an application that
        makes GL calls to draw its contents, and then wants to pass that
        rendered data to a compositing manager which itself makes GL calls to
        merge the application's output with other applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically the Linux kernel developers have avoided graphics APIs, but
        Intel's attempt,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Execution_Manager">GEM</a
        >, made it into the kernel in 2008, only to not be adopted by others.
        (Here's
        <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/283798/">a technical overview of GEM</a
        >.) There's a competing system called
        <a href="http://wiki.x.org/wiki/ttm">TTM</a>, which again in the API
        layering stew apparently can be used to implement the GEM API. It's
        unclear which of these systems is succeeding; some sources claim GEM is
        be Intel-specific while others say TTM is obsolete. (Nvidia's
        proprietary driver of course uses its own system.)
      </p>
      <p>A bonus aside: found this hilarous comment on a GEM article.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"GEM will be a waste of time, despite Intel's fame.</p>
        <p>PCI/ISA bus are hopeless, with USB 3.0 coming.</p>
        <p>
          Linux operating system maybe replaced with 8 bit ascii ocde table as
          function keys in cisc cpu with asic funstions, running 8 bit
          multicored cpus? The old cpu instructions can be replaced with Posix
          packets runing cloud computing servers. Data transfer is now planned
          to be Mpeg4/AVC."

        I believe that passing GL surfaces between processes is a relatively
        modern concept: I vaguely recall it only was exposed to userland in OS X
        in the last few releases, where it was used as SPI in Safari's out of
        process plugin wrapper to composite the rendered plugin contents into
        the browser window (warning: read with suspicion, I can't find a
        reference for this online). However, OS X itself is clearly composited,
        so it must have had some system for doing this already. (I'd love to
        fill in this paragraph with info from someone more knowledgable.)
      </p>

        Chrome has multiple processes rendering in parallel, but due to the
        sandbox the GL calls themselves are proxied across process boundaries,
        not the resulting rendered buffers.
        <a
          href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/gpu-accelerated-compositing-in-chrome"
          >See the design doc</a
        >. This is less terrible than it may sound, as OpenGL is designed as an
        async client/server API already: your commands must be relayed to the
        GPU anyway. For example, creating a texture gives you an integer ID for
        it and future calls use that ID, and there are lots of APIs around
        uploading collections of data (like vertex coordinates) to the GPU that
        you intend to use repeatedly.
      </p>

        <strong>Wayland and X11</strong>. X is the oldest piece and the center
        of the Linux graphics stack. It has its tentacles in everything: it has
        graphics drivers of its own, it touches DRI/DRM, GLX targets it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wayland was born when its author noticed that modern software doesn't
        really use X anymore. The core of Wayland is a protocol to let multiple
        clients communicate when they've updated buffers they've rendered, and
        then Wayland's compositor (a separate program that speaks the Wayland
        protocol) puts those buffers on screen using DRI directly. Toolkits like
        GTK which mostly sidestep X anyway can (and already have) been
        retargeted to use Wayland directly; code to speak the X protocol and
        render into a Wayland buffer would allow existing X apps to work. It
        makes sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully with all of the above terms fresh in your memory the
        <a href="http://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html">FAQ</a> will make a
        lot more sense to you; I know it did for me. (For example, Wayland
        relies on EGL because it's the only GL platform interface on Linux that
        doesn't itself rely on Xlib; because Nvidia's driver targets GLX, it
        won't work with Wayland.)
