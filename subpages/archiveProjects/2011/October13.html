        In a former life I was briefly involved in the Atom syndication format.
        In the syndication world people often fretted about whether content
        needed to be "double escaped" — for example, whether an ampersand needed
        to be "encoded" as <code>&amp;amp;</code> or <code>&amp;amp;amp;</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using those terms is thinking about the problem the wrong way. Quoting
        is needed when you embed one language in another (or even a language
        within itself). Well-defined languages have explicit rules — e.g. to
        embed plain text in HTML, <code>&amp;</code> must be encoded as
        <code>&amp;amp;</code>, and the same rule applies when embedding HTML
        into XML — and so to judge "how much" escaping is needed you must just
        follow those rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        The confusion with RSS was not about whether the languages were
        well-defined, but rather because it wasn't clear which language you were
        using: whether your feed contains plain text or HTML. (Atom attempted to
        address this with a more careful spec, which means that eight years
        later, blog software must now support
        <a href="https://neugierig.org/content/unix/"
          >multiple incompatible formats</a
        >, I still sometimes see literal <code>&amp;#39;</code>s in Google
        Reader, and have successfully avoided ever participating in another
        specification process again.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Language-layering confusion is rampant in the programming world, perhaps
        because the rules for embedding are so fuzzy in spoken languages. Here
        are a collection of instances of ways it can go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ruby</em>. In Ruby's
        <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.2/String.html#method-i-gsub"
          >string substitution function</a
        >
        (example: <code>"foobar".gsub("bar", "baz")</code>), the first argument
        may be a regex. Did you know that <em>second</em> argument, the
        replacement, is not literal text?
        <a href="http://evan-tech.livejournal.com/209849.html"
          >It leads to some surprising behavior</a
        >. The fact that the function usually behaves as if the second argument
        is literal text means that it's easy to write a bug here (consider
        taking untrusted user input and passing it through as the second
        argument to <code>gsub</code>), a pattern we'll see frequently below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>UTF-8</em>. Embedding ASCII into UTF-8 is trivial — no change. This
        makes it very easy to write code where you mix up which of the two
        you're dealing with. See e.g. how Evite
        <a href="http://evan-tech.livejournal.com/251031.html"
          >transformed a single UTF-8 character into 16 backslashes</a
        >
        — probably went through multple layers of systems, each of which thought
        it needed to escape the backslashes for the next.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think Python is especially hard to get right in the presence of
        Unicode strings, though I've read rumors that 3k helps. The Go language
        defines its <code>string</code> type as UTF-8 and provides a separate
        type for collections of bytes, but even at this early stage you see them
        getting it wrong (e.g. the
        <a href="http://golang.org/pkg/net/textproto/">textproto package</a>
        provides <code>string</code>s but doesn't discuss encoding anywhere).
      </p>
      <p>
        This area of problems is strangely one of the motivations of using
        UTF-16 for Unicode text in Chrome: it's much harder to accidentally
        stuff random data into a
        <a
          href="https://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2010/07/wstring-removal.html"
          >UTF-16 string class</a
        >.

      <p>
        <em>Text-based games</em>.
        <a href="http://jens.mooseyard.com/">Jens</a> once told a story about a
        MUD where a programming error in parsing the text of a user making an
        utterance would actually allow the text the user was "speaking" to
        escape into the programming logic of the game itself. It was a
        unintentional but true form of magic: you could defeat the dragon by
        simply speaking the magic words (!) — which were likely metacharacters.
        (I'd love to hear more details on this story, if anyone has them; my
        memory has surely corrupted it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Command lines</em>. On Unix systems, A command line is an array of
        strings: a program name and its arguments. There is no single defined
        thing that you could call a "command line string". You can represent a
        command line array of strings as a single string but in doing so you are
        again crossing a language level: you must define the syntax of how your
        array is flattened.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Unix systems, that language is almost always the language of the
        shell, which has a mini-language of metacharacters described in e.g. the
        "QUOTING" section of the bash man page.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when we talk about command line strings on Unix systems, we typically
        mean "command lines as encoded in the language of the shell". (This
        isn't necessarily always the case! <code>.desktop</code> files, as used
        to create icons on your desktop for Gnome/KDE/etc. use a
        <a
          href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s06.html"
          >different syntax</a
        >
        for command lines.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is one lesson I'd like you learn from this post, it is that
        there is no such thing as "a command line string" but rather "a command
        line string as interpreted by bash". I wouldn't be surprised if there
        were dark corners in the syntax here where a given command string would
        be interpreted differently by different systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Windows, command lines are a bit more confusing (and a little
        terrifying to me): commands are executed with a string command line, and
        it's up to each program to parse that string into arguments — it's up to
        each program decide on the language used to represent the array. In
        practice the C runtime does the the parsing before delivering an
        <code>argv</code> to <code>main()</code>. You can
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17w5ykft(v=vs.85).aspx"
          >read the MSDN docs</a
        >
        to discover that language — the rules are surprisingly tricky!
      </p>
      <p>
        In Chrome, for reasons unclear to me (perhaps the above parsing rules
        have changed across MSVC versions?) we actually discard the
        <code>argv</code> passed to <code>WinMain()</code> and instead call out
        to Windows APIs to get the original command line string to parse it.
        When generating command lines we do

        <em>Ninja</em>. Command lines and quoting have recently been of special
        interest to me because of my
        <a href="https://github.com/martine/ninja">Ninja build system</a>, which
        (due to not doing much else) deals a lot with command lines. As part of
        Ninja's minimalist philosophy, it treats the command lines you provide
        as opaque strings, with no tokenization of parameters. This means that,
        as described above, on Unix we hand those strings through to a shell.
        (On Windows it's a bit more up in the air; I still need to read through
        my backlog of bug mail to better describe what behavior is desirable or
        best.)
      </p>
      <p>
        With my lessons learned from all of the above, I tried to keep the Ninja
        syntax as simple as possible. Here's an attempt at summarizing the
        rules: Newlines are significant, <code>$</code> is always a
        metacharacter; <code>$</code> followed by text is interpreted as a
        variable reference, <code>$</code> followed by <code>$</code> evaluates
        to just <code>$</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially Ninja had used backslashes for line continuations, but doing
        so takes backslashes out of the source language, which makes it
        impossible to express Windows paths. After much delibaration I hit upon
        the simple solution of making <code>$</code> followed by a newline into
        a line continuation, which means backslashes are no longer magic. (The
        syntax is all generated by code anyway so adjusting my builds to adopt
        this was

          href="https://github.com/martine/ninja/commit/55fd4232d35de1f163310333d216d81a35cc0ef1#misc/ninja.py"

        >.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Make</em>. Ninja parses Makefiles as generated by gcc. I attempted
        to discover what the quoting rules are for Makefiles, but could only
        find scattered references in the documentation.

          >I summarized them in a comment</a

        line that ends in a backslash.

        <em>The web</em>. Half the security problems you see (SQL injection,
        XSS) on the internet can be interpreted as a language-mixing problem. I
        won't even go into it, but instead link to

        <em>mbox files</em>.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">The mbox format</a>
        represented a collection of email messages concatenating them together,
        each with a line starting with "<code>From</code>". But wait, what if
        the messages themselves contain such a line? And here the approaches
        diverged; some attempted to escape such a line by inserting a character,
        like "<code>&gt;From</code>", neglecting the fact that this now made it
        impossible to represent a line with that literal text in the new format.
        The result:

        The popular "mailman" software suite used to manage mailing lists
        includes a generated archive (see
        <a href="https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/">webkit-dev</a>,
        for example). In principle it provides downloadable archives, but
        unfortunately in practice it gets the mbox rules wrong and produces a
        file that is impossible to parse without making heuristic guesses as to
        the boundaries of messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Conclusion</em>. Is there a lesson here? I'm not sure. All software
        is full of bugs, here are some more.

      <p>
        I think this kind of nitpicky detail is just the sort of thing that type
        systems are especially good at getting right, but they only help if
        you're careful to use a new type at each language boundary: "ok, this
        string is the content of the mail message, and now we transform that
        into the mbox language..."
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe the mental model I use, of always associating a given string with
        a given language will help you keep things straight, like the implicit
        numeric base we use with numbers: "123" implicitly means "123 in base
        10". The next time you have a user's name and want to print it,
        hopefully you'll think "I need to convert that from base unicode into
        base bytestring suitable for stdout."
      </p>
      <p>
        With that framework in mind, spot the security bug: QuickTime, when it
        wanted to open a URL referenced in the movie file, opened it by running
        the equivalent of <code>system("browser.exe " + url)</code>. (For extra
        credit, why is this a problem even if you get all the escaping right and
        the browser really received the intended string as a command line
        argument?)
