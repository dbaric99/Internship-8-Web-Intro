        <h2><a href="">Linux on a G4 Mac Mini</a></h2>

      <p>
        I wanted to put Linux on this old Mac Mini so I can use it a file
        server. Some install instructions suggested burning a CD, but I don't
        have a CD burner handy. Others suggested booting off a USB stick, but
        the newer Debian/Ubuntu installer docs removed that section, and it's
        not clear how to partition the USB device. What to do?
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out it's relatively easy to completely install via the network
        due to Open Firmware's tftp support. You'll need a pretty standard
        networking setup (DHCP) along with a Linux box and a network wire for
        the Mac.
      </p>
      <p>
        Start by searching for [<a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/netinst"
          >debian netboot</a
        >], not to be confused with <em>netinst</em>: the former is how to net
        boot the installer, the latter is minimal CD images that download the
        remainder of the install from the internet. What you want is the netboot
        version of the netinst installer, and you'll find it in the "network
        boot" section of the above page.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a G4 Mac Mini, follow the link to the powerpc images, then navigate
        to <code>powerpc/netboot</code> and download the following files into a
        directory:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>yaboot.conf</code>, configuration for yaboot</li>
        <li><code>yaboot</code>, the boot loader</li>
        <li><code>boot.msg</code>, the bootup message</li>
        <li><code>vmlinux</code>, the kernel</li>
        <li><code>initrd.gz</code>, the rest</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (How to remember this file list? You need <code>yaboot.conf</code> and
        all files it references; it's a short text file.)
      </p>
      <p>Next, install tftp on your hosting machine. Run it like:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo in.tftpd -L -s path/to/files
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        It runs as root due to the port it uses, <code>-L</code> puts it in
        foreground mode, and <code>-s</code> makes paths relative to the
        directory you give it.
      </p>
      <p>To verify that tftp works, try a command like:</p>
      <pre><code>tftp localhost -c get yaboot.conf
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        Fix your setup if that command results in an error (for example, I
        learned the hard way that the Mac doesn't like pulling files from a
        subdirectory).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then boot the Mac into Open Firmware by holding Windows-Alt-O-F (that's
        Command-Option-O-F on a Mac keyboard) as it boots. At the prompt, tell
        it to fetch yaboot:
      </p>
      <pre><code>boot enet:192.168.1.114,yaboot
        </code></pre>
      <p>(adjust the IP as necessary).</p>
      <p>From that point, just follow the menus. Simple.</p>
      <p>
        (But actually it was not so simple to figure out the above. If you run
        into yaboot errors like
        <code>can't read elf e_ident/e_type/e_machine info</code> or the
        installer being unable to detect your disk, I found both of those were
        solved by using the latest version of Debian, and not Debian stable or
        the most recent PPC Ubuntu.)
      </p>
      <p>
        PS: wow was OS X slow on this thing. I can't believe it was considered
        tolerable at the time of release.
