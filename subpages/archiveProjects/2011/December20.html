      <p>
        It's natural, when writing an event-driven application, to want to
        perform disk operations like file reads and writes in the same
        non-blocking manner you use for sockets.
      </p>
      <p>
        This turns out to be hard. In theory there's POSIX AIO, but it's
        reported to not really work on Linux (my info might be out of date).
        Async libraries like node.js use an internal thread pool to simulate its
        desired event-behavior for files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes in discussions about this people point longingly at Windows,
        which does have an API for performing overlapped disk operations. See
        <a href="http://tinyclouds.org/iocp-links.html"
          >Ryan Dahl's nice overview</a
        >
        for a ton of links. In fancy apps like Chrome, subsystems like the disk
        cache use overlapped IO on Windows and threads on non-Windows, with the
        hope that Windows async IO involves less overhead (less bookkeeping,
        fewer copies, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        But it turns out that Windows async IO is just broken. In any of a
        number of situations, including if your disk is encrypted, Windows will
        silently make your async file operations synchronous. See
        <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/156932">this MSDN doc</a> for a
        list of other potential reasons. Special highlights include how
        extending a file's length is synchronous unless you use a special API,
        while that API on NTFS file systems requires a special privilege that is
        only available to administrators by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't write this to just say "man, Windows sure sucks" — the Linux
        situation is worse, and this may well all have been fixed in Windows 7.
        But rather I observe that there is just a ton of API surface in an
        operating system, and any of it may block (see e.g.
        <a href="http://brad.livejournal.com/2228488.html"
          >Brad discussing sendfile</a
        >). (In Chrome's case, we found via instrumentation that real users were
        encountering browser hangs because its supposedly async disk interface
        wasn't async for seeking within a file.) In practice for anything you
        want to be truly asynchronous you probably need to use a thread. You can
        still use the AIO APIs, if you have some that work, from that thread.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two ways to interpret that conclusion. One is that trying to
        make a synchronous world async in a piecemeal fashion doesn't work, and
        instead it's better to make it easy to coordinate synchronous tasks —
        the Go model (see
        <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/talks/threads07/"
          >rsc's convincing slides</a
        >). The other view is that the problem is the synchronous system, and
        any work we can do to move away from that the better — the node model,
        where you replace the world.
