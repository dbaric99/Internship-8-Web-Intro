        I left Google this month, after 17 years working there. At the time I
        left, out of ~150k employees, only ~300 had worked there longer than me.
        I have many stories, and I imagine I might tell some of them on this
        blog at some point. Rather than try to fit everything into one post I
        thought I'd instead use this post just as a brief announcement and small
        summary of my career there.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am not the sort of person who worries a lot about their career growth.
        I never was a manager and I was always happy to just quietly hack on
        interesting problems. If you can find the right corners to work in,
        Google is a pretty great place for that kind of attitude. (Google is
        also massive and others have had lots of very different experiences from
        mine.)
      </p>

        I worked on many things over those nearly two decades. A few things I
        can say I feel directly responsible for are
        <a href="../../chromiumNotes.html">Chrome for Linux</a> and the
        <a href="../2020/May12.html">Ninja build system</a>, a
        <a
          href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US"
          >multi-million-user Android app</a
        >, and making
        <a href="../2018/September01.html"
          >TypeScript one of the primary languages at Google</a
        >. (Of course, sucessful projects rely on many people's contributions,
        not just me.) I also contributed to many other projects, like this
        <a
          href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/helping-computers-understand-language.html"
          >fancy NLP in web search</a
        >
        and plenty of stuff that is not visible to the public. One bit of my
        legacy that most Googlers will recognize is Epitaphs; I also had a
        widely read blog there, which is one reason I haven't posted much in
        public lately. Because of the TypeScript work I was also one of ~30
        "global approvers", with the access to approve code changes to any
        project at the company.

        17 years is also a lot of life beyond making some software. I got to
        work from Tokyo for half a year; started the San Francisco Chrome team;
        was
        <a
          href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/google-chrome-making-cross-platform-browser"
          >"interviewed*" in a magazine</a
        >
        and <a href="/content/newsweek/page1small.jpg">pictured in Newsweek</a>;
        went on a flight in Ken Thompson's plane; travelled for work to all
        sorts of places including Israel, Poland, and Germany; hung out, learned
        from, and befriended so many people who were so much smarter and more
        talented than me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I moved to California to work for Google, and
        <a href="../2020/February25.html">my move away from California</a>
        led to the end of my career there. The full story is complex but
        effectively a bureaucratic mistake led to my position falling into
        question, despite plenty of support for keeping me around from my
        immediate management chain. This led me to follow through on an
        interview at Figma, which is a company I have been following for years
        and where I will work next. (Edit: I read some speculation online about
        this section. I was intentionally vague in part because I didn't mean
        for any drama. I left on good terms; my employment problems were fully
        resolved before I left; my last evaluation at Google was "strongly
        exceeds expectations"; and finally, I am not bitter about it. Rather, it
        was just a situation that led to me looking around and finding something
        new that appealed to me.)
      </p>

      <p>
        In all, I am very grateful to Google. But maybe the best
        characterization of my feelings about Google is they're the same complex
        and uncomfortable feelings I have towards the US as a US citizen: it's a
        place that I know is filled with brilliant, kind, interesting people,
        and it's a place that has given me nearly everything in my life,
        including the money to buy the home I now live in and even the health
        insurance responsible for the birth of my son â€” but it's also ultimately
        not something to be anthropomorphized, but rather a faceless machine
        that makes often bad decisions that I don't have any real influence
        over.
