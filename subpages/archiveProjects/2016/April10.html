      <p>
        Many questions about TypeScript's type system and implementation can be
        answered by understanding one of their central design goals: the
        <em
          >output (generated JavaScript) is independent of the types found in
          the input</em
        >. This seems simple enough but it has some surprising consequences.
        Here are some answers to questions you might have that are actually
        already answered by this principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Can a program with type errors still compile and produce JS?</strong
        >
        Yes, because the output is the same no matter the types. (There's a
        compiler flag, <code>--noEmitOnError</code> to say "don't generate any
        output when there's an error"; you might want to turn it on
        <a href="">in your <code>tsconfig.json</code></a>
        for serious apps.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The compiler can even generate something if the input has syntax errors
        though that is likely not what you want. Type some gibberish in the
        <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/">TypeScript playground</a>
        to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Can plain JavaScript files without any type annotations be transpiled
          by the compiler?</strong
        >
        Yes, because of the prior point. (You have to
        <a
          href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What's-new-in-TypeScript#including-js-files-with---allowjs"
          >opt in to allow the <code>.js</code> extension</a
        >.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >How do I make a run-time decision based on the underlying type of a
          variable?</strong
        >
        E.g. if a function accepts some <code>BaseClass</code> param, is there a
        way to determine which subclass was actually passed? The answer is no,
        unless you provide some method on <code>BaseClass</code> yourself or use
        <code>typeof</code>/<code>instanceof</code>, which only knows about the
        types that JavaScript knows about. (This is true in any language, of
        course â€” if the type is only known at run time, it must be a run-time
        type query!)
      </p>
      <p>
        However, see also the
        <a
          href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/What's-new-in-TypeScript#user-defined-type-guard-functions"
          >docs on type guards</a
        >
        for some assistance from the compiler.

      <p>
        <strong>Are TypeScript union types the same as sum types?</strong> A
        TypeScript union type is written like <code>string|number</code>, which
        looks a lot like a sum type as written in ML/Haskell. But a union type
        just means the variable (or return type of a function, etc.) can be
        either of the options, and determining which requires a
        <code>typeof</code>/<code>instanceof</code> check to determine the
        run-time JavaScript type. In contrast, an ML-style sum type has a type
        tag that e.g. requires you to pattern match to extract the contained
        value.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Why provide these weak-looking union types? Because TypeScript is
        attempting to model existing JavaScript usage, and many APIs such as
        jQuery semantically are already using union types. Also, as you'll see
        in a future post, these union types end up being pretty powerful.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Can I use <code>for (... of ...)</code> to iterate through ES6
          maps?</strong
        >
        Because the generated code is independent of types, when targeting ES5
        output, for-of loops always generate plain
      </p>
      <pre><code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; x.length; i++) ...
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        loops. When targeting ES6 output, the output is the same as the input, a
        for-of loop. This means you can't use a for-of loop to iterate through
        an ES6 map when targeting ES5 output, which is pretty disappointing!
      </p>
      <p>
        There are open bugs on this but the solution is not obvious. Perhaps the
        right thing would be to polyfill ES6 iterators and always use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How do overloaded functions work?</strong> TypeScript lets you
        write code with overloaded functions like this:
      </p>
      <pre><code>function add(a: number, b: number): number;
        function add(a: string, b: string): string;
        function add(a: any, b: any): any { return a + b; }
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        However, because the output is the same regardless of the types, you
        already know that the first two type-only definitions are dropped in the
        output. You can only proivde a single definition of a function to
        JavaScript, and that function, which provides the actual implementation,
        must be compatible with all the different type signatures declared. (In
        practice, overloaded functions are mostly used to describe the types of
        existing JS libraries.)
