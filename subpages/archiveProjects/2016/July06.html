      <p>
        The development branch of TypeScript (which will be TypeScript 2.0)
        added support for nullable types — letting you express, in the type
        system, whether a type is possibly null or not. I think the
        implementation is neat and unlike what I've seen in other languages so I
        thought I'd write a post about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For background, recall TypeScript's design space: it is modelling the
        way existing JavaScript code works. (This constraint really helps
        prevent them from going off into architecture astronaut land for new
        type system features!) If you look a browser JavaScript API such as
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify"
          ><code>JSON.stringify</code></a
        >
        you'll see that, for example, if you pass a number as the third argument
        ("<code>space</code>") it does one thing and if you pass a string it
        does a different thing. Many APIs work in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        TypeScript models this behavior with <em>union</em> types, which at
        first look like the sum types you see in ML/Haskell/Rust but are
        actually quite different. Think of types like sets of allowed values:
        the type "number" is the set {1, 2, 3, ...}, and a function that accepts
        a <code>number</code> accepts any value in that set. Or a more complex
        example: the structural type "<code>{foo: number}</code>" is the set of
        all objects that have a <code>foo</code> property of type
        <code>number</code> (including <code>{foo: 1}</code> or
        <code>{foo: 3, bar: 4}</code>).
      </p>
      <p>
        A union type then is just a union of sets: <code>string|number</code> is
        a set that includes <code>1</code> and also <code>"hello"</code>. Using
        that for the <code>space</code> parameter to
        <code>JSON.stringify</code> correctly models you may pass it a number or
        a string but nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
        What can you do if you have a value with a union type? Here's where it's
        easy to get confused. If you have <code>x: string|number</code>, what
        methods are available on <code>x</code>? The set of operations you can
        do with a type are the things that <em>all</em> values in the type
        implement, which ends up being the <em>intersection</em> of the
        operations. Both <code>string</code> and <code>number</code> have a
        <code>.toString()</code> method, so you can safely call
        <code>.toString()</code> on <code>x</code> regardless of its value, but
        there isn't much else. (To see for yourself, hit ctl-space after the
        final period on
        <a
          href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#src=let%20x%3A%20string%7Cnumber%3B%0D%0Ax."
          >this example</a
        >.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, usually what you do with a union type is a type test to see
        which sort of value you actually have; presumably
        <code>JSON.stringify</code> does something like
      </p>
      <pre><code>if (typeof space === 'string') {
          ...string-specific behavior...
        }
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        (This check is morally similar to the pattern-match you might do in an
        ML-derived language, but in those languages you match on the enum value,
        not the type. One way to see this difference is to see that Haskell's
        <code>Either</code> has <code>Left String | Right String</code>, while
        in TypeScript the type <code>string|string</code> is equivalent to just
        <code>string</code>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, here's where nullability fits in. In previous TypeScripts, any
        variable can also have the value <code>null</code>. (And there's also
        <code>undefined</code>, which shows up in uninitialized variables and a
        few other situations. Why is it that both <code>null</code> and
        <code>undefined</code> exist? Because JavaScript.) From the "types are
        sets" perspective, it's easy to see this means every type implicitly
        includes <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> in its allowed set
        of values.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to add nullability checking to TypeScript, all they needed to do is
        remove those implied members of the sets. With strict null checking on,
        when you write <code>string</code> the type admits strings only. The
        language then declares a new type named <code>null</code> that is the
        set of just one value: <code>null</code>. To represent a possibly-null
        value, it's the union type <code>string|null</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost all remanining behavior then falls out of the existing union type
        semantics. For example, what can you do with a <code>string|null</code>?
        Well, there are no methods on <code>null</code>, so there's no methods
        on the union either. You probably want to do a test like we did earlier
        in the <code>JSON.stringify</code> example, but in this case, the test
        is a null check — and the compiler is helping you find where a null
        check is necessary!
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, the bulk of the nullability work in the TypeScript compiler
        seems to have been on improving the flow-sensitive type analysis.
        Consider code like:
      </p>
      <pre><code>let x: string|number = ...;
        if (typeof x === 'string') {
          // x has type 'string' here.
        } else {
          // by elimination, x must have type 'number' here.
          x *= 4;  // legal on numbers.
        }
        </code></pre>
      <p>
        The compiler must do the "by elimination" reasoning, so that it doesn't
        flag that <code>else</code> arm as an error. It already had logic for
        this before they added <code>null</code> (for cases like this
        <code>string|number</code> union type) but with nullability they found
        more places to improve it.
