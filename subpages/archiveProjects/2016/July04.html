      <p>
        One of my common tinkering projects has been writing terminal emulators,
        programs that do the work of e.g. xterm. There are a lot of interesting
        ideas in this space (I have my own to contribute!) but discussing them
        is a post for another day. Instead I thought I'd write a bit about the
        basics.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that writing a basic featureless terminal emulator is a
        nice way to try out a programming language because it touches on a few
        different things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The terminal emulation itself is a relatively simple self-contained
          parsing problem, which lets you exercise the nuts and bots of the
          language.
        </li>
        <li>
          To render the output you need some sort of keyboard input and
          graphical output, which lets you exercise the language's GUI libraries
          and how/whether it interacts with an event loop.
        </li>
        <li>
          It also touches some grungy Unix bits (ptys, ioctls), which give you a
          taste of the language's support for extension; most languages
          reasonably don't build pty handling into their standard library.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Perhaps because of this I've written experiments in C++, Haskell, Go,
        Rust, and likely some other languages that I've forgotten about. When I
        tell people about my terminal emulators most think it's a dumb idea and
        some say it might be hard, but the basics are really pretty simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your terminal emulator program runs another command (say,
        <code>bash</code>) as a subprocess. When that subcommand produces output
        you mostly just add it to the screen at the current position, perhaps
        representing the screen as a 2d grid of character cells, and the current
        cursor position as (row,column) pair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the subcommand's output also includes control codes, which are
        sequences of characters that change something; for example, if you see
        the output <code>"\e[34m"</code> (the <code>\e</code> here represents
        ESC, which is a byte value of 27) that means subsequent text should be
        blue. Other escape codes move the cursor, and so on. You can find charts
        of all the escape codes online.
      </p>
      <p>
        Processing these escapes is the parsing problem I mentioned above. This
        is straightforward until you encounter the problem of partial escapes.
        The subprocess is producing text — perhaps coming in slowly, if your
        terminal is ssh'd over some slow connection, or perhaps quite fast, if
        your terminal is running <code>find /</code> locally — and your code
        must interpret them. That is, what do you do if you get the first few
        bytes of an escape code but not the rest? (UTF-8 input, with multiple
        bytes representing a single codepoint, is an identical problem.)
      </p>
      <p>
        One option is to make the parser asynchronous: model the whole thing as
        a state machine that can be resumed at any point, so when you run out of
        input, bail, and then when you later get more input, pick up where you
        left off. This is pretty tedious and error-prone and the sort of thing
        that it feels like a language ought to help you with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another option is to synchronously wait for more data. However, in the
        context of a GUI you can't synchronously wait from the UI handling
        thread, so this gives you a chance to try out your test language's
        threads or coroutines (or goroutines). The background thread waits for
        the subprocess output and processes it as it arrives.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now you have a synchronization issue: the UI wants to draw the
        terminal content so it needs access to the layout and position, while
        the terminal emulation parser wants to update that state at the same
        time. If you just put a lock around it — read one command, then update
        state while holding the lock — you end up spending most of your time in
        locking (the vast majority of "commands" are just single bytes that are
        displayed as-is). Similar approaches (e.g. sending parsed terminal
        commands as they complete over a Go channel) also create tons of
        overhead (memory allocations and channel processing per input byte).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Aside: why even care about overhead? I dunno, this is just tinkering.
          The test case to run is <code>time find /</code> in an xterm; you'll
          see that it's limited by the terminal and X server CPU. In my good
          implementations I instead have the terminal emulator process the
          output as fast as possible, but the render of that output is locked to
          the compositor resync (so drawing happens only once every 16ms ~
          60fps).
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        My newest idea is a kind of hybrid: read to fill a buffer, lock once,
        parse as much from that as possible, and finally back up and save the
        tail to use after the next read if you hit the end of the buffer while
        in the middle of parsing an escape code.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach is potentially O(n^2) if an incomplete input comes a byte
        at a time, because each time around the outer loop we start over from
        the beginning; but in practice escape codes are ~10 bytes at most and
        the very worst (the one that sets the window title) is more like ~100
        bytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other problem with this approach is that it mostly defeats the
        paralellism benefit of the concurrent design. The terminal processing
        code holds the lock the entire time it's doing its processing, then
        releases it when it goes back to sleep to wait for more input, while the
        paint code must wait for the lock when it wants to paint. There are two
        threads but they mostly take turns. Perhaps you have a better idea?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wanted to write your own terminal emulator there are some other
        details, like ptys (see <code>man pty</code>) and the window size (<code
          >man tty_ioctl</code
        >) but they're easy enough to muddle through. Hopefully in future posts
        I will be able to show you something cool.
