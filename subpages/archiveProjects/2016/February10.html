      <p>
        After three years of surveys, I'm working on something new at work:
        investigating using the TypeScript language for future Google apps.
        Whether that will go anywhere is still unclear to me, but in the
        meantime I've learned a new appreciation for TypeScript and I thought
        I'd share what I've learned with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most TypeScript tutorials open by diving into the type system, as that
        is the new shiny thing. But for the purposes of deciding whether you
        should use TypeScript for your next project the typing part is almost
        irrelevant, and can just be summarized as "it adds a static type system
        to JavaScript that is designed to work with existing libraries". If you
        like static types then you probably know more or less what that implies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead here's all the stuff I wished I had known about
        <em>other</em> than the type system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Services daemon and editor integration.</strong> The TypeScript
        compiler is designed as a daemon that can answer questions about your
        code (e.g. "what is the type of the variable <code>foo</code>?"). This
        design means that your editor can call into the daemon to get all the
        fancy IDE-like features — such as code-aware variable renaming or
        clicking on a function to jump to its definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact this interface is already implemented by many editors, including
        the IDEs but also Sublime Text, Vim, and Emacs. I personally use Emacs
        and get red squiggly lines in my editor under code with errors in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Project layout.</strong> For this services daemon architecture
        to work, your editor must be able to invoke TypeScript in the same way
        (with the same options and input paths) as you would at build time. To
        do this they standardized on a shared config file that specifies these
        settings: when invoked, the tooling looks for your project root by
        crawling directories upwards until it finds a
        <code>tsconfig.json</code>, which contains all the settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that (1) when creating a new project, you need one of these
        files in the root directory (it's created by running
        <code>tsc --init</code>, much like how you'd run
        <code>git init</code> in a new project); and (2) to build, you always
        invoke the compiler with <em>no arguments</em>, as they are all
        specified by the <code>tsconfig.json</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my work I've found this model serves as a brake to keep build configs
        from getting too crazy, because if you're doing something in your build
        system that can't be expressed in <code>tsconfg.json</code> then you
        lose your fun editor features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Incremental compilation.</strong> In previous attempts with
        TypeScript I was frustrated by the compilation speed. To be clear, the
        compiler is decently fast — a second or two for a small project, perhaps
        comparable to whatever today's ES6 transpiler is once you layer in the
        build systems and plugins and whatever goop you use to execute it — but
        compilation was slow enough that it broke the flow of reload debugging
        (as you might experience in a plain JS project). It turns out that
        TypeScript is actually designed to work faster than that, but you must
        let the compiler process hang around between compilations via the above
        daemon architecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice this means you run <code>tsc --watch</code> when writing
        code and it incrementally recompiles whenever you save. In an internal
        project I found the compiler was fast enough that you could actually
        recompile on every keystroke because it took under 20 milliseconds to
        recompile a hot small file. (Experimenting with
        <code>tsc --watch</code> produced compilation times more like a second
        on my laptop. From a peek at the code I saw that it doesn't compile
        immediately on save but instead waits a bit first to debounce multiple
        saves.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also worth noting that if you're using one of the above-mentioned
        editor integrations (which you should), then your editor is marking
        errors while you write code and you will only build when you intend to
        run the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Module systems.</strong> TypeScript accepts ES6 JavaScript as
        input and can produce ES5 as output. ES6 has a syntax for importing
        modules (which is another way of saying "multiple-file projects"), which
        TypeScript cares about because it must traverse files to check types.
        But in terms of generated code it just transpiles imports into
        equivalent imports in another module system that you configure; for
        example, one option for output is the
        <code>var foo = require('foo');</code> used by nodejs and some others.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to actually build a single JS file from multiple inputs you
        must use some sort of bundler or module loader external to the
        TypeScript compiler. You might notice that the compiler has some flags
        that let you specify a single output file; to use that output in a
        browser unfortunately still requires the involvement of a module loader
        library. (Of course, if you're targeting nodejs then you can just
        produce its import syntax and everything just works.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Implicit any.</strong> One way to use TypeScript is to add it
        incrementally to a project by just renaming <code>*.js</code> to
        <code>*.ts</code>. By default, places where you don't provide a type
        annotation (like in function arguments) are then understood to have type
        <code>any</code>, which effectively means types are unchecked. In this
        model the thinking is that TypeScript will locally analyze functions
        (where types are inferred), then you can add annotations as you see fit
        to discover more bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other way to use TypeScript is to have the compiler tell you when
        it's guessing. The compilation flag <code>noImplicitAny</code> instead
        makes it a compiler error to leave out the types when they are needed.
        This flag can be flipped in the <code>tsconfig.json</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Conclusion.</strong> In all, I've been pretty impressed by
        TypeScript. It feels right to me in the engineery sense, where they have
        made good tradeoffs in the pursuit of making a useful tool. I'm hopeful
        for its future.
