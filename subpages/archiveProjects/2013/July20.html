      <p>From a monad tutorial written in 1970:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "The more you understand our thinking, the more you find it difficult
          to talk about it. The purpose of my talking is to give you some idea
          of our way, but actually, it is not something to talk about, but
          something to practice. The best way is just to practice without saying
          anything. when we talk about our way, there is apt to be some
          misunderstanding, because the true way always has at least two sides,
          the [practical] and the [theoretic]. When we talk about the
          [practical] side, the [theoretic] side is missing, and when we talk
          about the [theoretic] side, the [practical] side is missing. We cannot
          speak in a [practical] and [theoretic] way at the same time. So we do
          not know what to say. It is almost impossible to talk about [monads].
          So not to say anything, just to practice it, is the best way."
