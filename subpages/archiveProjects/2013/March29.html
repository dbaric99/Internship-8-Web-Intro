      <p>
        Making things — writing, software or blog posts — is hard. The end
        result is always unsatisfactory. I like to say: the only clean code is
        the code you promise yourself you'll write next time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A younger me would recognize this and point it out, sometimes
        semi-anonymously sniping other people's work. I wasn't a cruel person, I
        think, more just frustrated that there is so much human capacity
        available and so much of it directed to frivolous or wasteful or
        pointless things.
      </p>

        As I grew up and realized I was simply wrong.

        Even the very worst software, the most incoherent (or worse, seemingly
        coherent but systematically flawed) blog post, at least was a chance for
        its author to focus and create — to gain some of the practice that is
        necessarily on the path to greatness. Making anything requires
        overcoming self-doubt and time constraints and distractions and it's
        something to be implicitly happy about, regardless of the result.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a little embarrassed by everything I've made, including this post,
        and that's just fine.
