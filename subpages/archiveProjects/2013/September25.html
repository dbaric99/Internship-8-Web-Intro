      <p>
        Large companies are notorious for succumbing to an excess of process;
        the term "small company" brings to mind a nimble organization, capable
        of making decisions quickly without red tape.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other side of this agility is a lack of oversight. I once read
        (maybe Spolsky?) decscribe a launch checklist (e.g. "step 4: get legal
        to check trademarks") as a list of everything that's ever gone wrong at
        a company. Each accident throughout a company's history is followed by a
        postmortem that concludes with adding another item to the checklist of
        roadblocks ("next time, also verify the relevant twitter account is
        available"). With each year the process grows.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been thinking about this recently due to reading
        <a
          href="http://www.somebits.com/weblog/tech/bad/google-wallet-spam.html"
          >Nelson's post about getting spammed by Google Wallet</a
        >. (I feel it's maybe worth highlighting my disclaimer: though I work at
        Google, I am a mere cog; my facts may well be wrong because I only know
        what I read online.) Nelson posted that he got an email from Google full
        of ads, without a link to opt out, and with a footer that claimed the
        message was a "mandatory service announcement".
      </p>
      <p>
        I was surprised to read this in part because for the product I work on
        we recently wanted to email our customers. (Distinct from Wallet,
        "customers" here refers to people who've actually paid us money for a
        service we provide.) To send an email from Google, there is of course a
        process; as far as I understand it this involves integrating with a
        Google-wide service that manages tracking whether a given user had opted
        in to emails, provides them opt outs, etc. "Process" is often a bad word
        but here it seems reasonable enough. (I wasn't involved with this
        integration, I just heard about it. Remember: cog.)
      </p>
      <p>
        And though I don't know the facts of what happened with this Wallet
        mail, it appears as if someone skipped the process. "It is better to ask
        for forgiveness than permission", we cry... and then spam. What went
        wrong? The missing element, I think, is that with a smaller group of
        people it's easier to get in alignment about goals and values. At some
        point, someone somewhere decided that sending this mail this way was ok
        when you and I can say it's not. (Nelson, who started at Google in 2001,
        didn't like it either.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So maybe another way of looking at process is that it's a necessary
        evil, used to defend an institution against the wrong values. (This
        isn't to defend the idea but rather recognize it as inevitable.) Another
        way of looking at it is that this kind of process becomes necessary when
        you can no longer trust one another to do the right thing, which is
        pretty depressing and more or less the reason I
        <a href="">quit working on Chrome</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        PS: For all I know, in this particular case maybe someone just
        accidentally misclicked the wrong checkbox when sending the email, and
        the only lesson we'll learn is to add yet another step to the process to
        double-check the checkbox.
