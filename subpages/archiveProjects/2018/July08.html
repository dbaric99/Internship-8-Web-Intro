        <h2><a href="">Why not add an option for that?</a></h2>
        <span>July 08, 2018</span>
      </div>

      <p>
        If you've ever developed software you've surely had users ask you to add
        an option. "Rather than forcing everyone into behavior A," they'll
        reason, "why not add an option so users can choose between behaviors A
        and B?"
      </p>
      <p>
        This post is an attempt at producing a canonical consolidated answer to
        why the answer to this is often "no".
      </p>
      <p>
        But first: it's worth pointing out that
        <strong>sometimes the right answer really is to add an option</strong>.
        The answer is not absolutely "no", it's rather "usually no, but maybe it
        overcomes the objections in this post". With that in mind, let's look at
        the costs of options.
      </p>
      <h3>Options are bad user experience</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A good tool solves its purpose so directly that it's not even
            noticed. Great designs need fewer options because they just work as
            is. The reason the user opened the the software is to achieve some
            end, not poke around in the software's options. Maybe you can come
            up with a better design that addresses the use cases of the option?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            At the extreme, options may just be asking the user to make a
            decision about something that the designer failed at. There's a
            <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/12/choices/"
              >great post about this by Joel Spolsky</a
            >, which highlights an especially egregious Windows dialog that
            asked the user to choose database parameters for the help system.
            Making decisions like these can be hard, but often if they're hard
            for the developer they're even harder for the user who has even less
            context.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice"
              >paradox of choice</a
            >" is the counterintuitive result that more options reduce
            happiness, by introducing cognitive load for things that should be
            straightforward. (Disclaimer: the repeatability of the experiments
            implying this phenomenon are in dispute.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The presentation of options (via a GUI or command-line docs) itself
            is a UX problem — how do you organize them, how do users discover
            them? — that becomes harder with more options. Adding a unimportant
            option obscures the options UI for the truly necessary options. For
            example, does the <code>--help</code> output fit on one screen or
            not? In the limit software developers give up on organization and
            add a search box (like about:config in Firefox or the equivalent
            search box in Chrome).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Even when there's an option that already solves some user problem,
            many users won't discover it, because they just aren't interested
            enough in the software to look through all the options to judge
            whether any are relevant for their task. For example, Firefox's
            "Master Password" feature is only used by 0.0087% of its users, and
            it's hard to say if that is because the feature is unpopular or if
            it's because there are users who would want this feature but don't
            know to look for it or what it is called.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A great example of software with poor options UX is Git. Git is a tool
        with a simple clear conceptual core that's been absolutely wrecked by
        uncritical thinking around the design of the options. The
        <a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/"
          >git man page generator</a
        >
        parodies this by generating ludicrous but plausible documentation for
        Git. There are plenty of other examples, though.
      </p>
      <h3>Options are features, and features are costly</h3>
      <p>
        You can think of software development as the accumulation of features
        over time. Spending time implementing the feature of my-new-option means
        that you are not implementing the feature of more-important-other-thing.
        The right way to look at the tradeoff is not "why not implement option
        X?" but rather "why implement option X instead of [more important thing
        I could be doing]?" Those other more important things could themselves
        be features or options but they also can be unobservable core work like
        making the software more efficient or crash less.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might reasonably argue that an option is cheap — maybe just an extra
        <code>if</code> statement, maybe someone even wrote the patch already —
        but in practice there are more questions than that.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>How does the option get toggled?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>How is the presence of the option communicated to the user?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Does it need documentation?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Does it need localization? (E.g. if it adds a user-visible menu item
            or help output.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Does it need localized documentation?</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Writing the patch that adds the option ends up being a small part of the
        total work required, and the bulk of the work falls on whoever ends up
        maintaining the result.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Implementing a feature is a one-time cost, but keeping it working is an
        ongoing cost
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>How do we verify that future changes don't break the option?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What happens if we change the program in such a way that the option
            doesn't make sense anymore? For example, suppose the option adds an
            entry to a menu and changes in the program mean that rest of the
            menu is no longer needed — do we keep the menu just for the one
            option?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What happens when you change the UI around options? If it's a
            checkbox, where does the checkbox go when you move other checkboxes?
            If it's a command-line flag, where does it go if your program splits
            into subcommands?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If at some point we believe the option might no longer be necessary
            and that no users actually even use it, how can we determine whether
            it's safe to remove?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Options can be costlier than features</h3>
      <p>
        In fact, as far as features go, optional behavior can be even worse for
        maintenance than always-on behavior, because options produce features
        that aren't consistently present.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            How does this option interact with other options? If we have N
            toggleable options, do we need to test the software in all 2^N
            possible configuration? For example, if one option is "hide button X
            from the toolbar" and a later option is "hide button Y from the
            toolbar", does the toolbar correctly handle having two adjacent
            missing buttons?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Which other features does this interact with? Do we need to run
            every test we have with both the option on and off, or is there a
            subset of places where the option might affect things?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Every time we edit the surrounding code in the future, the option
            adds more complexity in reasoning through the code.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the option is dependent on some system-local property, how can we
            ensure we don't break the option without access to such a system?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            When a user reports a bug, which options are relevant to triggering
            the bug, and can they know this?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a bug is only encountered when an unpopular option is on, it may
            go unreported and remain undiscovered.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>If options are so bad, why do users want them so much?</h3>
      <p>
        Hopefully the above convinces you that new options aren't to be
        introduced lightly. So why do users so often ask for them? Here are a
        few reasons.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Users are concerned about their particular use case, and tunnel on
            solving it without consideration for the whole system. "When I do X
            it takes three clicks," they think, "so you should add an checkbox
            like <code>[] make it two clicks</code>."
          </p>
          <p>
            This even comes up sometimes when a program has a genuine bug, like
            say it deletes the user's work in some circumstance, and the user
            will request "add an option to make it not delete my work" rather
            than the more obvious solution of not losing their work. (While
            drafting this post, I coincidentally had a perfect example of this
            come up —
            <a
              href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/ninja-build/FJTIQiRBK20/discussion"
              >this user</a
            >
            encountered a genuine bug and asked if there was a flag to suppress
            the bug.) There's a
            <a href="https://xkcd.com/1172/">great xkcd</a> taking this to the
            logical extreme, where the user demands an option to make the
            program waste CPU.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Users see no cost, only benefits. If you ask a user "should I add a
            feature where ____?" they almost always will answer yes even before
            the blank is filled in.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        If you're a user, even if you found this unconvincing, you can hopefully
        at least use it as a way to more successfully advocate for adding
        options to your favorite software. You can use this template: "Adding an
        option for <em>A</em> is more important than fixing bug
        <em>B</em> because <em>C</em>. It is impossible to design for this use
        case because <em>D</em>, it won't have much maintenance cost because
        <em>E</em>, and other users will know where to find it because
        <em>F</em>."
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're a software developer, you already know that your
        responsibility is to balance all of the use cases simultaneously against
        other factors like opportunity cost and maintenance cost. It is my hope
        that at you can cite this essay as a way to avoid repeating the same
        arguments.
