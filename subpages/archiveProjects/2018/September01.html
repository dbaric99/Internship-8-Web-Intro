      <p>
        I've been working on TypeScript for over two years now(!) so I thought
        I'd write a post or two to reflect. I should open with the standard
        disclaimer: I am just a random engineer at a company with tens of
        thousands of them, and that others surely disagree with the opinions
        expressed here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google embraced web applications early. Can you believe it's been 14
        years since Gmail was released? JavaScript back then was pure madness.
        Gmail engineers had to worry so much about Internet Explorer's poor
        garbage collection algorithm that they'd need to manually hoist string
        literals out of for loops to avoid GC pauses. I recently found a design
        doc from that era where they considered doing what today we'd call
        "minifying" the JavaScript but noted that some candidate tools were
        Windows-only. Today that feels unimaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over those years Google built lots of infrastructure for making big
        JavaScript apps. For example, there's a module system to let source
        files express their interdependencies. There's a bundler that combines
        and minifies source files into browser-compatible artifacts. Another
        piece analyzes an app's dependency graph by dynamically-loadable entry
        points and factors out common subset chunks for serving. Server-side
        rendering is common. All of these concepts are familiar to a web
        developer today but Google's stack predates today's, evolved in
        parallel, and is consequently conceptually similar but concretely
        totally different, with different processes, tools, and even names for
        these ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        In another example of parallel evolution, each of Google, Facebook, and
        Microsoft built similar but incompatible compilers that add static
        checks to JavaScript. Google's compiler is colloquially called Closure.
        (Not to be confused with the Clojure language; for extra confusion note
        that ClojureScript uses the Closure compiler.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Google's JavaScript stack is unevenly great. It has enabled Google to
        write and maintain web apps that have changed the face of the internet.
        (Remember how amazing Maps was when it came out? Today it seems boringly
        obvious to make a draggy map widget.) There are pieces of it that
        surpass the best of today's technologies. For example, the Closure
        compiler is perhaps still the most sophisticated JavaScript optimizer,
        able to do things like optimize code using type information, inline
        functions across hot-loading chunk boundaries, and strip unused code
        down to

      </p>
      <p>
        Google's JavaScript stack also has problems. The incremental evolution
        from a linter means Closure is a statically typed variant of JavaScript
        where language features are introduced in comments. Closure has
        unpredictable semantics, it's slow, it's buggy, and it tends to mangle
        your code unless you hold it just right. Though it is open source,
        perhaps because of these reasons it isn't widely used in the industry
        except at companies that hire Googlers who are familiar with it. Within
        Google I think JavaScript has a low reputation in part because of our
        finicky tools, which combine the verbosity of a static language with the
        unpredictability of a dynamic one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, outside of Google, JavaScript also continued to evolve and
        surprisingly even became popular. In part to work around those IE
        garbage collection bugs we built Chrome which led to v8 which led to
        nodejs which means most web tools today are themselves written in
        JavaScript, unlike the Java used to build this sort of tool at Google.
        Module systems (UMD, AMD, CommonJS) proliferated. (ES6 also came along
        and invented its own module system that is incompatible with all the
        others for some reason, sigh.) npm unified the way tools and libraries
        are shared. Webpack can
        <a href="https://webpack.js.org/concepts/hot-module-replacement/"
          >dynamically swap modules</a
        >
        into a running application while you develop it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google uses none of this. Experienced webdevs show up at Google and it's
        like visiting an alternative timeline. There's a CSS preprocessing
        language like SASS but it's not SASS and nobody likes it. The fancy
        chunk-splitter doesn't really support third-party JavaScript libraries
        in part because the tools predate the existence of a JavaScript library
        ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's all just history. You can argue we shouldn't have gotten to this
        place but it doesn't change that we're here now. Instead the interesting
        question is: where do we go now? There are a few options. My perspective
        is surely biased by the one I prefer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first tempting option is to just abandon this ruined planet and
        settle a new one that doesn't even involve JavaScript. If only we
        invested more in GWT (a Google project that compiles Java to JavaScript)
        or Dart (a Google project that compiles a new language to JavaScript) or
        WASM or [insert your favorite language here — Clojure? Haxe? Elm?] we
        wouldn't need to worry about JavaScript at all!
      </p>
      <p>
        As a PL enthusiast I'm pretty fond of this idea. I'd like to give it the
        careful analysis it deserves, but this post is long enough and I think
        that discussion would work as its own post. Instead of a full
        refutation, here are some mundane concerns: adopting a different
        language (1) does nothing for the literally millions of lines of
        existing code we have — "rewrite from scratch in a new language" is the
        correct choice for some situations, but it's a hard argument to make as
        the best use of gmail engineers' time — and (2) it does little for the
        aforementioned experienced frontend programmers that we would like to
        hire.
      </p>
      <p>
        The opposite of rewriting everything is to change nothing. The public
        JavaScript world, you could correctly point out, is full of amateur code
        and leftpad disasters. A good engineer can always adapt to our
        idiosyncratic way of making frontends and we can always improve or build
        more of own tools. I am sympathetic to this view. I think there's a
        point in the space of tradeoffs where it makes sense to build our own
        tools, and another point at which we've diverged so far from the
        mainstream that our tools are a liability. The argument is then about
        where we are in that space, and I believe we're drifted too far towards
        the latter. We benefit from contributing to LLVM/Clang because we depend
        on C++, but we wouldn't get much additional value from building our own
        LLVM.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which leads me to the middle path, which my little team has been
        pursuing: incrementally adopt some external tooling where it makes
        sense, by figuring out how to make it interoperate with our existing
        code base. This task isn't as fun — we don't get to just throw away our
        legacy mess and "do it right this time" — but I like to think rather
        more humble, looking outward rather than inward.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part of our bridge from the Google JavaScript Galapagos back
        to the mainland was adopting a well-supported static checker that is (1)
        not home-grown; (2) popular already, while similar to our existing code;
        (3) designed to bridge into JavaScript; (4) designed to support the
        large-scale development that motivated our custom tools in the first
        place. And that tool is TypeScript. The strength of the Closure compiler
        is its optimized output, while TypeScript has a great user interface and
        no optimization at all. The two tools are complementary and (with some
        work) can be layered together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because TypeScript already mostly works — that's part of the reason to
        adopt it, after all — we get many of the benefits of adopting an
        established language, from IDE-style code completion to being able to
        check StackOverflow for answers. The work that's left for us has
        primarily been integration: allowing our apps to incrementally move into
        TypeScript without rewriting from scratch.
        <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_typescript"
          >Our integration into the Google-wide build system</a
        >
        is careful to compile incrementally, which is critical for large apps;
        changes in one module that don't affect its exported API don't cause
        downstream modules to recompile. Our integration into the Closure
        type/module system means that ES6 TypeScript modules can
        <a href="https://github.com/angular/clutz"
          >import Google-module-system modules</a
        >
        and <a href="https://github.com/angular/tsickle">the reverse</a>, with
        (much of) the type information preserved.
        <a
          href="https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2017/11/16/converting-600k-lines-to-typescript-in-72-hours/"
          >One company successfully used the tools we published</a
        >
        to automatically translate their entire code base while preserving their
        minified output.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within Google TypeScript is now found in varying quantities everywhere;
        it's likely if you use Google products you've interacted with some
        TypeScript code. TypeScript itself is a bunch of interesting
        compromises, balancing a statically typed programming language against
        the free-wheeling JavaScript ecosystem. But that's what we engineers do:
        we make interesting compromises that attempt to balance different
        concerns. I hope to write more in the future about some of interesting
        corners we've discovered over the years. As I
        <a href="">wrote when we first started down this path</a>, I think
        TypeScript makes good tradeoffs within the design space.
